            Trunk-based development is a popular development model because it simplifies version control. Since the trunk is a single source of truth, this model minimizes the chances of merge conflict.`

            Features are worked on specific “feature branches” (typically prefixed with feature/). In the same fashion, releases also create a dedicated release/ branch.
            
            Compared with trunk-based development, Gitflow is more complex and has a higher chance of inducing merge conflicts, which is why it has fallen out of favor among the development community.`

            Continuous delivery is an extension of CI. Its goal is to automate every step required to package and release a piece of software. The output of a continuous delivery pipeline takes the form of a deployable binary, package, or container.
            
            Continuous deployment is an optional step-up from continuous delivery. It is a process that takes the output from the delivery pipeline and deploys it to the production system in a safe and automated way.

            --- <b>Improved productivity:</b> freed from the manual labor of building and testing the code, developers can focus on the creative aspects of coding.

            On the other hand, a cloud-based CI platform does not need maintenance. There’s nothing to install or configure, so organizations can immediately start using them. The cloud provides all the machine power needed, so scalability is not a problem. Finally, the reliability of the platform is guaranteed by SLA.`

An improperly secured CI/CD system is a prime target for attacks and can be exploited to release compromised software or to get unauthorized access.

            --- <b>Canary releases:</b> this is a method that reduces the chance of failure by exposing a small portion of the userbase (around 1%) to the release. With a canary release, developers gradually switch users to the latest release in a controlled way.
            --- <b>Blue-green releases:</b> consists of running two simultaneous instances of an application; one is the stable version currently serving users and the other the latest release. Users are switched from the former to the latter all at once. This method is safer than the regular or big bang releases because users can instantly be routed back to the previous version if there is a problem.
            --- <b>Dark launches:</b> are deployments where new features are released without being announced. Features can be enabled in a very fine-grained way with feature flags.`

            The TDD cycle consists of three steps:
            
            1. Red: write a test that fails.

            Acceptance testing is the practice of verifying acceptance criteria. Acceptance criteria is a document with the rules and behaviors that the application must follow to fulfill the users’ needs. An application that fulfills all acceptance criteria meets the users’ business needs by definition.
            
            The confusion stems from the fact that acceptance testing implements the acceptance criteria verification with end-to-end testing. That is, an acceptance test consists of a series of end-to-end testing scenarios that replicate the conditions and behaviors expressed in the acceptance criteria.`
