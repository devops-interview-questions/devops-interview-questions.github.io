                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Version control is a set of practices and tools for managing codebases. Developers use version control to keep track of every line of code, and share, review, and synchronize changes among a team.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A Git repository keeps track of every file in a software project. The repository serves as an index for all files and changes in the project, allowing developers to navigate to any point in the project’s history.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A Git branch is an independent line of development, usually created for working on a feature. Branches let developers code without affecting the work of other team members.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is merging?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Merging consists of joining branches. For example, when developers incorporate their peer-reviewed changes from a feature branch into the main branch.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is trunk-based development?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Trunk-based development is a branching model where most of the work takes place in a single trunk, usually called trunk, master, or main. The trunk receives daily merges from all developers in the team.

            Trunk-based development is a popular development model because it simplifies version control. Since the trunk is a single source of truth, this model minimizes the chances of merge conflict.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is Gitflow, and how does it compare to trunk-based development?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Gitflow is a workflow for Git that makes heavy use of branches. In Gitflow, all the code is merged into the develop branch instead of the main branch, which serves as an abridged version of the project’s history.

            Features are worked on specific “feature branches” (typically prefixed with feature/). In the same fashion, releases also create a dedicated release/ branch.
            
            Compared with trunk-based development, Gitflow is more complex and has a higher chance of inducing merge conflicts, which is why it has fallen out of favor among the development community.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">How long should a branch live?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">In the context of continuous integration, branches should follow trunk-based development practices and thus be short-lived. Ideally, a branch should last for a few hours or, at most, a day.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development methodology where developers — following the trunk-based model — merge their changes to the main branch many times per day.

            CI is supported by automated tests and a build server that runs them on every change. As a result, failures are made visible as soon as they are introduced and can be fixed within minutes.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">How do CI and version control relate to one another?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Every change in the code must trigger a continuous integration process. This means that a CI system must be connected with a Git repository to detect when changes are pushed, so tests can be run on the latest revision.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What’s the difference between continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Continuous integration (CI) executes the sequence of steps required to build and test the project. CI runs automatically on every change committed to a shared repository, offering developers quick feedback about the project’s state.

            Continuous delivery is an extension of CI. Its goal is to automate every step required to package and release a piece of software. The output of a continuous delivery pipeline takes the form of a deployable binary, package, or container.
            
            Continuous deployment is an optional step-up from continuous delivery. It is a process that takes the output from the delivery pipeline and deploys it to the production system in a safe and automated way.

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">• <b>Less risk:</b> automated tests reduce the chance of introducing bugs, creating a safety net that increases the developer’s confidence in their code.
            • <b>More frequent releases:</b> the automation provided by continuous delivery and continuous deployment allows developers to release and deploy software safely many times per day.
            • <b>Improved productivity:</b> freed from the manual labor of building and testing the code, developers can focus on the creative aspects of coding.
            • <b>Elevated quality:</b> CI acts as a quality gate, preventing code that is not up to standards from getting released.
            • <b>Better design:</b> the iterative nature of continuous integration lets developers work in small increments, allowing a higher degree of experimentation, which leads to more innovative ideas.</p>

            • <b>Speed:</b> the platform should be fast and scalable to obtain results in a few minutes.
            • <b>Reproducibility:</b> the same code should always yield the same results.

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A hosted CI server must be managed like any other server. It must be first installed, configured, and maintained. Upgrades and patches must be applied to keep the server secure. Finally, failures in the CI server can block development and stop deployments.

            On the other hand, a cloud-based CI platform does not need maintenance. There’s nothing to install or configure, so organizations can immediately start using them. The cloud provides all the machine power needed, so scalability is not a problem. Finally, the reliability of the platform is guaranteed by SLA.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Yes. CI/CD platforms have access to all kinds of sensitive data such as API keys, private repositories, databases, and server passwords. An improperly secured CI/CD system is a prime target for attacks and can be exploited to release compromised software or to get unauthorized access. A CI/CD platform must support mechanisms to securely manage secrets, and control access to logs and private repositories.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">• <b>Regular release/deployment:</b> releases software to everyone at once, making it available to the general public.
            • <b>Canary releases:</b> this is a method that reduces the chance of failure by exposing a small portion of the userbase (around 1%) to the release. With a canary release, developers gradually switch users to the latest release in a controlled way.
            • <b>Blue-green releases:</b> consists of running two simultaneous instances of an application; one is the stable version currently serving users and the other the latest release. Users are switched from the former to the latter all at once. This method is safer than the regular or big bang releases because users can instantly be routed back to the previous version if there is a problem.
            • <b>Dark launches:</b> are deployments where new features are released without being announced. Features can be enabled in a very fine-grained way with feature flags.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Testing is integral to and inseparable from CI. The main benefit teams get from CI is continuous feedback. Developers set up tests in the CI to check that their code behaves according to expectations. There would be no feedback loop to determine if the application is in a releasable state without testing.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Yes, CI requires that all tests are automated. They must work without human intervention.

            That is not to say that manual or exploratory testing don’t have their places. They are very useful for discovering potential features and finding further test cases to automate.</p>

            • <b>Unit tests:</b> validate that functions or classes behave as expected.
            • <b>Integration tests:</b> are used to verify that the different components of an application work well together.
            • <b>End-to-end tests:</b> check an application by simulating user interaction.
            • <b>Static tests:</b> finds defects in code without actually executing it.
            • <b>Security tests:</b> scans the application’s dependencies for known security issues.
            • <b>Smoke tests:</b> fast tests that check if the application can start and that the infrastructure is ready to accept deployments.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A test that intermittently fails for no apparent reason is called a flaky test. Flaky tests usually work correctly on the developer’s machine but fail on the CI server. Flaky tests are difficult to debug and are a major source of frustration.

            Common sources of flakiness are:
            
            • Improperly handled concurrency.
            • Dependency on test order within the test suite.
            • Side effects in tests.
            • Use of non-deterministic code.
            • Non-identical test environments.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is TDD?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software design practice in which a developer writes tests before code. By inverting the usual order in which software is written, a developer can think of a problem in terms of inputs and outputs and write more testable (and thus more modular) code.

            The TDD cycle consists of three steps:
            
            1. Red: write a test that fails.
            2. Green: write the minimal code that passes the test.
            3. Refactor: improve the code, and make it more abstract, readable, and optimized.

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is the main difference between BDD and TDD?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">If TDD is about designing a thing right, Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is about designing the right thing. Like TDD, BDD starts with a test, but the key difference is that tests in BDD are scenarios describing how a system responds to user interaction.

            While writing a BDD test, developers and testers are not interested in the technical details (how a feature works), rather in behavior (what the feature does). BDD tests are used to test and discover the features that bring the most value to users.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is test coverage?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Test coverage is a metric that measures how much of the codebase is covered by tests. A 100% coverage means that every line of the code is tested at least by one test case.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">Does test coverage need to be 100%?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">No. There’s a myth that 100% coverage means that the code is bug-free. This is false; no amount of testing can guarantee that. Attempting to reach full test coverage is considered bad practice because it leads to a false sense of security and extra work when code needs to be refactored.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">How can you optimize tests in CI?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">First, we need to identify which tests are the slowest and prioritize accordingly. Once we have a plan, there are several methods for making tests faster. Some of them are:

            • Breaking large tests into smaller units.
            • Removing obsolete tests.
            • Refactoring tests to have fewer dependencies.
            • Parallelizing tests.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What’s the difference between end-to-end testing and acceptance testing?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">End-to-end usually involves testing the application by using the UI to simulate user interaction. Since this requires the application to run in a complete production-like environment, end-to-end testing provides the most confidence to developers that the system is working correctly.

            Acceptance testing is the practice of verifying acceptance criteria. Acceptance criteria is a document with the rules and behaviors that the application must follow to fulfill the users’ needs. An application that fulfills all acceptance criteria meets the users’ business needs by definition.
            
            The confusion stems from the fact that acceptance testing implements the acceptance criteria verification with end-to-end testing. That is, an acceptance test consists of a series of end-to-end testing scenarios that replicate the conditions and behaviors expressed in the acceptance criteria.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">Why we use LINUX?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">LINUX is used widely because it is completely different from other operating systems where every aspect comes with something extra i.e. some additional features.
    
            Some of the major reasons to use LINUX are listed below:
            
            • It is an open-source operating system where programmers get the advantage of designing their own custom OS
            • Software and the server licensing required to install Linux is completely free and can be installed on many computers as required
            • It has low or minimum but controllable issues with viruses, malware, etc
            • It is highly secured and supports multiple file systems</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Following are some important features of the LINUX operating system:
    
            • Linux Kernel and application programs can be installed on any kind of hardware platform and thus are considered portable.
            • It serves the purpose of multitasking by serving various functions simultaneously.
            • It provides security services in three ways namely, Authentication, Authorization, and Encryption.
            • It supports multiple users to access the same system resource but by using different terminals for operation.
            • Linux provides a hierarchical file system and its code is freely available to all.
            • It has its own application support (to download and install applications) and customized keyboards.
            • Linux distros provide live CD/USB to their users for installation.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">LILO (Linux Loader) is the boot loader for the Linux operating system to load it into the main memory so that it can begin its operations. Bootloader here is a small program that manages a dual boot. LILO resides in MBR (Master Boot Record).
    
            Its major advantage is that it allows the fast bootup of Linux when installing in the MBR.
            
            Its limitation lies in the fact that it is not possible for all computers to tolerate modification of MBR.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is Swap space?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Swap space is the amount of physical memory that is allocated for use by Linux to hold some concurrent running programs temporarily. This condition usually occurs when RAM does not have enough memory to support all concurrent running programs. This memory management involves the swapping of memory to and from physical storage.
    
            There are different commands and tools available to manage the Swap space usage.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">As the name suggests, it is like a system administrator account which gives you the ability to fully control the system. The root account serves as the default account whenever Linux is installed.
    
            Below mentioned functions can be performed by the Root account:
            
            • Create user accounts
            • Maintain user accounts
            • Assign different permissions to each account created and so on.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">When there are multiple windows available on the current desktop and there appears the problem of minimizing and maximizing windows or restoring all the current programs, there ‘Virtual Desktop’ serves as an alternative. It allows you to open one or more programs on a clean slate.
    
            Virtual desktops are basically stored on a remote server and serve the following benefits:
            
            • Cost savings as the resources can be shared and allocated as and when required.
            • Resources and energy are more efficiently used.
            • Data integrity is improved.
            • Centralized administration.
            • Fewer compatibility issues.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">GUI stands for the Graphical User Interface. GUI is considered as the most attractive and user-friendly because it consists of the usage of images and icons. These images and icons are clicked and being manipulated by the users for the purpose of communication with the system.
    
            <b>Advantages of GUI</b>:
            
            • It allows users to navigate and operate the software with the help of visual elements.
            • The more intuitive and rich interface is possible to be created.
            • Fewer chances of occurrence of errors as complex, multi-step, dependent tasks are easily grouped together.
            • Productivity is enhanced with the means of multitasking as with a simple click of the mouse, the user is able to maintain multiple open applications and transitions between them.
            
            <b>Disadvantages of GUI</b>:
            
            • End-users have less control over the operating system and file systems.
            • Although it is easier to use a mouse and keyboard for navigation and controlling the operating system, the whole process is a bit slow.
            • It requires more resources because of the elements that need to be loaded such as icons, fonts, etc.</p>

It is a way for humans to interact with computers and is also known as the Command-line user interface. It relies on textual request and response transaction process where user types declarative commands to instruct the computer to perform operations.
    
            <b>Advantages of CLI</b>
            
            • Very flexible
            • Can easily access commands
            • Much faster and easier to use by expert
            • It does not use much CPU processing time.
            
            <b>Disadvantages of CLI</b>
            
            • Learning and remembering type commands is hard.
            • Have to be typed precisely.
            • It can be very confusing.
            • Surfing web, graphics, etc are a few tasks that are hard or impossible to do on the command line.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Different parts of LINUX say kernel, system environment, graphical programs, etc are developed by different organizations. LINUX Distributions (Distros) assemble all these different parts of Linux and give us a compiled operating system to be installed and used.
    
            There are around six hundred Linux distributors. Some of the important ones are:
            
            • <b>UBuntu</b>: It is a well known Linux Distribution with a lot of pre-installed apps and easy to use repositories libraries. It is very easy to use and works like a MAC operating system.
            • <b>Linux Mint</b>: It uses cinnamon and mates desktop. It works on Windows and should be used by newcomers.
            • <b>Debian</b>: It is the most stable, quicker and user-friendly Linux Distributors.
            • <b>Fedora</b>: It is less stable but provides the latest version of the software. It has a GNOME3 desktop environment by default.
            • <b>Red Hat Enterprise</b>: It is to be used commercially and to be well tested before release. It usually provides a stable platform for a long time.
            • <b>Arch Linux</b>: Every package is to be installed by you and is not suitable for beginners.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">How can you determine the total memory used by LINUX?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">It is always required to keep a check on the memory usage in order to find out whether the user is able to access the server or the resources adequately. There are roughly 5 methods that determine the total memory used by Linux.
    
            This is explained as below:
            
            • <b>Free command</b>: This is the most simple command to check memory usage. For Example, ‘$ free –m’, the option ‘m’ displays all the data in MBs.
            • <b>/proc/meminfo</b>: The next way to determine memory usage is to read /proc/meminfo file. For Example,  ‘$ cat /proc/meminfo’
            • <b>Vmstat</b>: This command basically lays out the memory usage statistics. For Example,  ‘$ vmstat –s’
            • <b>Top command</b>: This command determines the total memory usage as well as also monitors the RAM usage.
            • <b>Htop</b>: This command also displays memory usage along with other details.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Every file and directory in Linux are assigned three types of owners namely ‘User’, ‘Group’, and ‘Others’. The three kinds of permissions defined for all the three owners are:
    
            • <b>Read</b>: This permission allows you to open and read the file as well as list the contents of the directory.
            • <b>Write</b>: This permission allows you to modify the contents of the file as well as allows adding, removing and renaming files stored in the directories.
            • <b>Execute</b>: Users can access and run the file in the directory. You cannot run a file unless the execute permission is set.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A system administrator or the owner of the file can grant permissions using the ‘chmod’ command. Following symbols are used while writing permissions:
    
            • ‘+’ for adding permission
            • ‘-‘ for denying permission
            
            Permissions also include a single letter which denotes
            • <b>u</b>: user; 
            • <b>g</b>: group; 
            • <b>o</b>: other;

            • <b>Is</b>: This command list out all the files in the directed folder.
            • <b>cd</b>: This stands for ‘change directory’. This command is used to change to the directory you want to work from the present directory. We just need to type cd followed by the directory name to access that particular directory.
            • <b>mkdir</b>: This command is used to create an entirely new directory.
            • <b>rmdir</b>: This command is used to remove a directory from the system.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Linux is considered a case sensitive. Case sensitivity can sometimes serve as the reason for displaying different answers for the same command as you might enter the different formats of commands each time. In terms of case sensitivity, the command is the same but the only difference occurs with regard to uppercase and lowercase letters.
    
            For Example,
            
            cd, CD, Cd are different commands with different outputs.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">For executing any commands user uses a program known as the shell. Linux shell is basically a user interface used for executing the commands and communicating with Linux operating system. Shell does not use the kernel to execute certain programs, create files, etc.
    
            There are several shells available with Linux which includes the following:
            
            • BASH (Bourne Again SHell)
            • CSH ( C Shell)
            • KSH ( Korn Shell)
            • TCSH
            
            There are basically two types of Shell commands
            
            • <b>Built-in shell commands</b>: These commands are called from the shell and executed directly within the shell. Examples: ‘pwd’, ’help’, ’type’, ’set’, etc.
            • <b>External/ Linux commands</b>: These commands are totally shell independent, have their own binary and are located in the file system.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">As the name suggests, the shell script is the script written for the shell. This is a program file or says a flat text file where certain Linux commands are executed one after another. Although the execution speed is slow, the Shell script is easy to debug and can also simplify everyday automation processes.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">The word stateless itself means ‘no state’. When on a single workstation, no state exists for the centralized server, and then the stateless Linux server comes into the picture. Under such conditions, scenarios like keeping all the systems on the same particular state can occur.
    
            Some of the features of Stateless Linux server are:
            
            • Stores prototype of every machine
            • Store snapshots
            • Store home directories
            • Uses LDAP which determines the snapshot of state to be run on which system.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What are system calls used for process management in Linux?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">System call provides an interface between user program and operating system. 
    
            When the user wants to give an instruction to the OS then it will do it through system calls. Or a user program can access the kernel which is a part of the OS through system calls.
            
            It is a programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system.
            
            The different system calls are as follows:
            
            • System calls for Process management
            • System calls for File management
            • System calls for Directory management
            
            A system is used to create a new process or a duplicate process called a fork.
            
            The duplicate process consists of all data in the file description and registers common. The original process is also called the parent process and the duplicate is called the child process.
            
            The fork call returns a value, which is zero in the child and equal to the child’s PID (Process Identifier) in the parent. The system calls like exit would request the services for terminating a process.
            
            Loading of programs or changing of the original image with duplicate needs execution of exec. Pid would help to distinguish between child and parent processes.
            
            Example
            Process management system calls in Linux.
            
            • <b>fork</b> − For creating a duplicate process from the parent process.
            • <b>wait</b> − Processes are supposed to wait for other processes to complete their work.
            • <b>exec</b> − Loads the selected program into the memory.
            • <b>exit</b> − Terminates the process.
            
            
            <b>fork()</b> − A parent process always uses a fork for creating a new child process. The child process is generally called a copy of the parent. After execution of fork, both parent and child execute the same program in separate processes.
            
            <b>exec()</b> − This function is used to replace the program executed by a process. The child sometimes may use exec after a fork for replacing the process memory space with a new program executable making the child execute a different program than the parent.
            
            <b>exit()</b> − This function is used to terminate the process.
            
            <b>wait()</b> − The parent uses a wait function to suspend execution till a child terminates. Using wait the parent can obtain the exit status of a terminated child.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">There are many commands present in Linux which are used to look at the contents of the file.
    
            Some of them are enlisted below:
            
            • <b>head</b>: Displays the beginning of the file
            • <b>tail</b>: Displays the last part of the file
            • <b>cat</b>: Concatenate files and print on the standard output.
            • <b>more</b>: Displays the content in pager form and is used to view the text in the terminal window one page or screen at a time.
            • <b>less</b>: Displays the content in pager form and allows backward and single line movement.

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">It is well known that every command takes input and displays output. Keyboard serves as the standard input device and the screen serves as the standard output device. Redirection is defined as the process of directing data from one output to another or even cases exist where output serves as input data for another process.
    
            There are basically three streams available in which input and output of the Linux environment are distributed.
            
            These are explained as below:
            
            • <b>Input Redirection</b>: ‘&lt;’ symbol is used for input redirection and is numbered as (0). Thus it is denoted as STDIN(0).
            • <b>Output Redirection</b>: ‘&gt;’ symbol is used for output redirection and is numbered as (1). Thus it is denoted as STDOUT(1).
            • <b>Error Redirection</b>: It is denoted as STDERR(2).</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Linux is an open-source operating system and nowadays it is growing rapidly in the tech world/market. Although, the entire code written in Linux can be read by anyone, then also it is considered more secure because of the following reasons:
    
            • Linux provides its user with limited default privileges which are basically restricted to the lower levels .i.e. in the case of any virus attack, it will reach only local files and folders where the system-wide damage is saved.
            • It has a powerful auditing system that includes detailed logs.
            • Enhanced features of IPtables are used in order to implement a greater level of security for the Linux machine.
            • Linux has tougher program permissions before installing anything on your machine.

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Command grouping is basically done by the use of braces ‘()’ and parenthesis ‘{}’. Redirection is applied to the entire group when the command is grouped.
    
            • When commands are placed within the braces, then they are executed by the current shell. Example, (list)
            • When the commands are placed within the parenthesis, then they are executed by a subshell. Example, {list;}</p>

            It can be used for the below purposes:
            
            • To find the full path of the current directory
            • Store the full path

            <b>cd syntax</b>: $ cd {directory}
            
            Following purposes can be served with ‘cd’ commands:
            
            • Change from current to a new directory
            • Change directory using the absolute path
            • Change directory using the relative path
            
            Few of the ‘cd’ options are enlisted below
            
            • <b>cd~</b>: Brings you to the home directory
            • <b>cd-</b>: Brings you to the previous directory

This command is used for matching a regular expression against text in a file. This command performs pattern-based searching and only the matching lines are displayed as output. It makes use of options and parameters that are specified along with the command line.
    
            For example: Suppose we need to locate the phrase “our orders” in an HTML file named “order-listing.html”.
            
            Then the command will be as follows:
            
            $ grep “our orders” order-listing.html
            
            The grep command outputs the entire matching line to the terminal.</p>

Network troubleshooting and configuration are essential parts of and network administration. The networking commands enable you to quickly troubleshoot connection issues with another system, check the response of another host, etc.
    
            A network administrator maintains a system network that includes network configuration and troubleshooting. Mentioned below are few commands along with their description:
            
            Mentioned below are few commands along with their description
            
            • <b>Hostname</b>: To view the hostname (domain and IP address) of the machine and to set the hostname.
            • <b>Ping</b>: To check if the remote server is reachable or not.
            • <b>ifconfig</b>: To display and manipulate route and network interfaces. It displays network configuration. ‘ip’ is the replacement of ifconfig command.
            • <b>netstat</b>: It displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics. ‘ss’ is the replacement of netstat command which is used to get more information.
            • <b>Traceroute</b>: It is a network troubleshooting utility that is used to find the number of hops required for a particular packet to reach the destination.
            • <b>Tracepath</b>: It is the same as traceroute with a difference that it does not require root privileges.
            • <b>Dig</b>: This command is used to query the DNS name servers for any task related to the DNS lookup.
            • <b>nslookup</b>: To find DNS related query.
            • <b>Route</b>: It shows the details of the route table and manipulates the IP routing table.

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Shell is a command interpreter, which interprets the command given by the user to the kernel. It can also be defined as an interface between a user and the operating system.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is Shell Scripting?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Shell scripting is nothing but a series or sequence of UNIX commands written in a plain text file. Instead of specifying one job/command at a time, in shell scripting, we give a list of UNIX commands like a to-do list in a file to execute it.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">• Shell script takes input from the user, file and displays it on the screen.
            • Shell scripting is very useful in creating your own commands.
            • It is helpful in automating some tasks of the day to day life.
            • It is useful for automating system administration tasks.
            • Mainly it saves time.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">There are mainly 4 important types of shells that are widely used.
    
            And they include:
            
            • Bourne Shell (sh)
            • C Shell (csh)
            • Korn Shell (ksh)

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What are the advantages of C Shell over Bourne Shell?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">• C shell allows aliasing of commands i.e. a user can give any name of his choice to the command. This feature is mainly useful when a user has to type the lengthy command again and again. At that point of time, instead of typing a lengthy command a user can type the name that he has given.
            • C shell provides a command history feature. It remembers the previously typed command. Thus, it avoids typing the command again and again.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">The two types of shell variables are:
    
            <b>1) UNIX Defined Variables or System Variables</b> – These are standard or shell defined variables. Generally, they are defined in CAPITAL letters.
            
            <b>Example</b>: SHELL – This is a Unix Defined or System Variable, which defines the name of the default working shell.
            
            <b>2) User Defined Variables</b> – These are defined by users. Generally, they are defined in lowercase letters
            
            <b>Example</b>: $ a=10 –Here the user has defined a variable called ‘a’ and assigned value to it as 10.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">How are shell variables stored? Explain with a simple example.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Shell variables are stored as string variables.
    
            <b>Example</b>: $ a=10
            
            In the above statement a=10, the 10 stored in ‘a’ is not treated as a number, but as a string of characters 1 and 0.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Variables can be made unchangeable using <b>readonly</b>. For instance, if we want variable ‘<b>a</b>’ value to remain as <b>10</b> and not change, then we can achieve this using <b>readonly</b>.
            
            <b>Example</b>:
            $ a=10
            $ readonly a</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Variables can be wiped out or erased using the <b>unset</b> command.
    
            <b>Example</b>:
            $ a =20
            $ unset a
            
            Upon using the above command the variable ‘<b>a</b>’ and its value <b>20</b> get erased from shell’s memory.
            
            <b>CAUTION</b>: Be careful while using this <b>unset</b> command.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Positional parameters are the variables defined by a shell. And they are used whenever we need to convey information to the program. And this can be done by specifying arguments at the command line.
    
            There is a total of 9 positional parameters present i.e. from $1 to $9.
            
            <b>Example</b>: $ Test Indian IT Industry has grown very much faster
            In the above statement, positional parameters are assigned like this.
            $0 -&gt; Test (Name of a shell program/script)
            $1 -&gt;Indian
            $2 -&gt; IT and so on.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A file name that begins with a. (dot) is called as a hidden file. Whenever we try to list the files it will list all the files except hidden files.
    
            But, it will be present in the directory. And to list the hidden file we need to use –a option of ls. i.e. $ ls –a.</p>

            The above permissions are mainly assigned to owner, group and to others i.e. outside the group. Out of 9 characters first set of 3 characters decides/indicates the permissions which are held by the owner of a file. The next set of 3 characters indicates the permissions for the other users in the group to which the file owner belongs to.
    
            And the last 3 sets of characters indicate the permissions for the users who are outside the group. Out of the 3 characters belonging to each set, the first character indicates the “read” permission, the second character indicates “write” permission and the last character indicates “execute” permission.
    
            <b>Example</b>: $ chmod 744 file1
    
            This will assign the permission rwxr–r–to file1.<p></p>

            • It provides a unique user id and password to the user, so that unknown or unauthorized person should not be able to access it.
            • At the file level, it provides security by providing read, write &amp; execute permissions for accessing the files.
            • Lastly, it provides security using file encryption. This method allows encoding a file in an unreadable format. Even if someone succeeds in opening a file, but they cannot read its contents until and unless it is decrypted</p>

            <b>3 methods of loops are</b>:

            • <b>While Loop</b>: This is used in a program when we want to do something for a fixed number of times. While loop gets executed until it returns a zero value.
            • <b>Until Loop</b>: This is similar to while loop except that the loop executes until the condition is true. Until the loop gets executed at least once, it returns a non-zero value.</p>

            When the keyword break is encountered inside any loop in the program, control will get passed automatically to the first statement after a loop. A break is generally associated with an if.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">In a shell, we can easily execute multiple scripts i.e. one script can be called from the other. We need to mention the name of a script to be called when we want to invoke it.
    
            <b>Example</b>: In the below program/script upon executing the first two echo statements of script1, shell script executes script2. Once after executing script2, the control comes back to script1 which executes a <b>pwd</b> command and then terminates.
            
            <b>Code for script1</b>
            <code>
            #!/bin/bash

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is Shell Scripting</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Text files containing commands to execute by a shell are called shell scripts. In this, long and repetitive series of commands are compiled into a single script that can be stored and executed at any time, thereby reducing programming efforts. In shell scripts, repetitive work is largely avoided. The most common reason for using shell scripting is to program operating systems of Windows, UNIX, Apple, etc. In addition, companies use this script to develop an operating system with their own features. In terms of system-level operations, it is considered to be the easiest programming language to use. A shell script is referred to as a batch file in DOS operating system, and EXEC in IBM's mainframe VM operating systems. Shell scripts can be used for the following applications: 

            • Automation of the code compiling process.
            • Run a program or create an environment for programming.
            • Complete batch processing and file manipulation.
            • Integrate existing programs.
            • Perform routine backups.
            • Keeping an eye on a system.
            • System administration's tasks
            • Creating, maintaining, and implementing system boot scripts
            
            <b>A sample shell script: </b>
            <code>echo "hello world" </code>
            
            <b>Run it as follows: </b>
            <code>$ bash hello.sh 
            # prints 
            hello world</code></p>

                    </div>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is Shell?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A Shell is basically a command-line interpreter between user and kernel or a complete environment specially designed to run commands, shell scripts, and programs. In this, whenever a user enters human-readable commands (input commands) through the keyboard, the shell communicates with the kernel to execute these commands, and display output in a shell script. Just as there are different flavors of operating systems, there are also different types of shells. Every shell has its own set of commands and functions. Shells issue the prompt, $, called a command prompt. You can type into the prompt while it is displayed.  

            After you press enter, your input is read by the shell. Based on the first word of your input, it determines the command you want to run. The characters in a word are separated using spaces and tabs.  
            
            <b>Example</b>: 
            
            Here is an example of a date command that displays the current date and time:  
            
            <code>$date Tue Aug 10 06:03:35 MST 2021</code></p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">Why is a shell script needed?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Shell scripts can be written for a variety of reasons:

            • Keeping repetitive tasks to a minimum.
            • Can be used by system administrators for routine backups.
            • Monitoring the system.
            • Adding new functions to the shell.
            • Shell scripting allows you to create your own tools.
            • System admin can automate daily tasks.

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Shell scripting offers the following benefits:

            • An interactive debugging tool, as well as a quick start.   
            • Programmers need not change their syntax since both command and syntax are identical to those entered directly into the command line.  
            • Shell scripts are easy to use and quicker to write.   
            • It helps automate administrative tasks, so it is time-saving.   
            • As shell scripts are written in an interpreted language, they can be run without any additional effort on almost any modern operating system, including UNIX, Linux, BSD, and Mac OS X.  
            • They can be utilized for bulk execution rather than single instructions.   
            • Using it, you can develop your own custom operating system with relevant features.  
            • Software applications can be developed according to their respective platforms with this tool.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Shell scripting has the following disadvantages:

            • Errors are frequent and costly, and a single error can alter the command.  
            • The execution speed is slow. 
            • Bugs or inadequacies in the language's syntax or implementation.  
            • Large, complex tasks aren't well suited to it.  
            • Contrary to other scripting languages, etc., it provides a minimal data structure.   
            • Every time a shell command is executed, a new process is launched.

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Shells are divided into two categories: 
            • <b>Bourne shell</b>: The $ character is the default prompt when using a Bourne-type shell.
            • <b>C shell</b>: The % character is the default prompt when using a C-type shell.

            The Bourne-type is subdivided into the following categories:
            
            • <b>Bourne Again shell (BASH)</b>: This is the most common shell available on all Linux and based systems. It is open-source and freeware. In addition, it is an SH-compatible shell, with improved programming and interactive features over SH. It also allows you to efficiently perform many tasks.
            • <b>Korn shell (KSH)</b>: Korn is basically a Unix shell that was initially based on the Bash Shell Scripting. It's a high-level language that's quite advanced. It has associative arrays and handles the loop syntax better than Bash. It is basically an improved version of Bourne shell.
            
            The C-type is subdivided into the following categories:   
            
            • <b>C shell (CSH)</b>: C shell is almost like C itself since it uses the shell syntax of the C programming language. In most cases, a command is executed either interactively from a terminal keyboard or from a file.
            • <b>TENEX/TOPS C shell (TCSH)</b>: TCSH does not have a specific full name. TCSH is considered as an enhanced version of the CSH as it includes some additional features over CSH like command-line editing and filename or command completion. As with the previous version, it supports C-style syntax also.

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">• <b>Bourne Shell</b>: It has compactness and speed that set it apart from other shells. But it lacks interactive features such as the ability to recall previous commands. Additionally, the Bourne shell does not support arithmetic and logical expressions.
            • <b>C Shell</b>: It is a UNIX enhancement that incorporates interactive features like aliases and history of commands. Besides its built-in arithmetic and expression syntax, it also includes convenient programming features.
            
            <b>Difference between Bourne shell and C shell</b>

            • The C shell allows you to alias commands easily, whereas Bourne Shell does not allow this.
            • In the C shell, long commands can be used repeatedly, but not in Bourne.
            • Bourne does not have access to the command history, but the C shell does.
            • In the case of C, there is no need to repeatedly type the command.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What do you mean by Shell variable?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Shell variables are integral parts of all Shell programs and scripts. In general, we know that variables usually store data either in the form of characters or numbers. Shell also stores and manipulates information using variables in its programs. Generally, shell variables are stored as strings. Variables in the shell provide the information needed for scripts/commands to execute. In the following example, a shell variable is created and then printed: 

            variable ="Hello" 
            echo $variable</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Shell scripts usually have two types of variables:  

            • <b>System-defined variables</b>: Also called environment variables, these are special built-in variables in the Linux kernel for each shell. They are normally defined in capital letters by the OS (Linux) and are standard variables.
            <b>Example</b>:  
            SHELL  
            It is a Unix Defined or System Variable, which specifies the default working shell. 
            
            • <b>User-defined variables</b>: These variables are created and defined by users in order to store, access, read, and manipulate data. In general, they are defined in lowercase letters. The Echo command allows you to view them.
            <b>Example</b>:    
            $ a=10 
            In this case, the user has defined the variable ‘a’ and assigned it the value 10.

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">Explain the term positional parameters.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">In a shell program, positional parameters specify arguments that are used to launch the current process. A special set of variables is usually maintained by the shell for storing positional parameter values. Bash is an example of a shell that uses positional parameters. The bash shell can be used on Linux, BSD, macOS X, and Windows 10.

            <b>For example</b>: 
            
            mycommand one five "six four”   
            
            In this case, the command name is mycommand, and there are four parameters in the command line: one, five, and "six four”.   
            
            <b>Note</b>: A space delimits each positional parameter and each thing after spaces are interpreted by the shell as individual parameters. Therefore, the parameter itself should be enclosed in quotation marks if it contains a space, as in "six four".</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Control instructions specify how the different instructions will be executed in the script. They are primarily used to determine the control flow in Shell programs. The execution of a shell script proceeds in succession without these instructions. In shell programs, control instructions govern how execution flows.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Shells provide four types of control instructions as given below:  

            • <b>Sequence Control Instruction</b>: This assures that a program's command runs in the sequence they are listed. As soon as the first command in the sequence has been completed, the second command follows, and so on.
            • <b>Decision Control Instruction</b>: It is also known as Selection Control Instruction. This instructs the computer which instruction it should execute next. In this, checking a condition is the basis for deciding which section to execute. If a given condition is True, a statement or set of statements will be executed; otherwise, they will be ignored.
            • <b>Loop Control Instruction</b>: It is also known as Repetition Instruction. This instruction allows a computer to continuously run a particular sequence of code. In a loop structure, the statements can be repeated until a condition is True or False, a particular number of times, or once for each element within the collection
            • <b>Case-Control Instruction</b>: This is used for selecting among several choices. Typically, they are used to execute only a particular block of statements within a series of statements.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Links present in Linux OS can be used to create shortcuts as given below: 

            • <b>Hard Link</b>: Hard links are mirror images of the originally linked files and are linked with an inode number. A hard-linked file remains even after the original file is deleted. Since hard links point to inodes, they cannot be implemented on directories. Hard links are created by the following command:
            <code>$ ln  [original filename] [link name]</code>
            
            • <b>Soft Link</b>: Generally, soft links (also referred to as Symbolic links) are linked to the file name and can reside on the same as well as different file systems. When a soft link is created or deleted, it does not affect the original file, but when the original file is deleted, the soft link stops working. Typically, soft links are aliases (alternative paths) for the original file. Soft links are created by the following command:
            <code>$ ln  -s [original filename] [link name]</code>
            </p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">How to check whether a link is a hard one or a soft link?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">We can use -h and -L operators of the test command to check whether a link is hard or soft (symbolic link).

            • <b>-h file      //true if the file is a symbolic link</b>
            • <b>-L file      //true if the file is a symbolic link</b>
            One can also use:
            
            <b>readlink FILE; echo $?</b>       // This returns 1 if it's a hard link and 0 if it's a symbolic link.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Shell scripts or programs often contain shebang at the top. In general, the Shebang (the series of characters "#!") is used to indicate the operating system to use a particular interpreter to process the rest of the file. Here, the symbol '#' is referred to as hash, and "!" is referred to as bang. This usually aids developers in avoiding repetitive work. Scripts are generally executed by the engine; therefore, shebang determines the location of the engine that will be used to run the script. 

            <b>Example</b>:  
            
            #!/bin/bash

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Generally, file systems are referred to as the collections of files, which include information related to those files. It would be impossible to tell where one piece of data stops and the next begins without a file system. There are four blocks in a file system: 

            • <b>Super Block</b>: A superblock contains information about a file system, including block size, group size, usage statistics, empty/filled blocks, inode table size &amp; location, and so on. One of the tools used to describe a file system, along with inodes, entries, and files, is the superblock. Multiple superblocks are created with the file system, as the superblock contains critical information.  
            • <b>Boot Block</b>: Located on the disk label, a boot block is a special set of blocks that contains data or information on the disk layout. Normally, this block contains the bootstrap loader program, which a user runs upon launching the host computer. The boot block remains blank if the file system is not used for boot.    
            • <b>Data Block</b>: Also called storage blocks, data blocks contain the remainder of the space allocated to the file system. The data block's size is measured at the time of file system creation. For a regular file, the content of files is contained in the data blocks. For directories, the inode number and file name of the files are contained in the data blocks.  
            • <b>Inode</b>: Inodes contain information about each file in the filesystem. Normally, an inode doesn't contain a file's name, which is located in a directory instead.  An inode contains information such as the type of file, the permission bits, the owner, the group, the file size, and the time when the file was modified.</p>

In other words, it is the list of commands that you wish to run on a regular schedule and the command that will let you manage it. It is possible to view or edit the table of commands using the crontab command. In addition to the schedule, the term "Crontab" also refers to the name of the program used to edit the schedule.</p>

Crontab command tasks such as creating, editing, displaying, or removing crontab files are relegated to specific users through these files. Both files usually consist of a list of user names, one user name per line. Together, these access control files perform the following functions:

            • cron.allow decides which users are allowed to run the crontab command.
            • cron.deny decides which users are denied from using the crontab command.
            • When cron.allow or cron.deny doesn't exist, superuser privileges are required to run it.</p>

Tar is an acronym for tape archive and is used to create backups using tar, gzip, and bzip. Files can be saved and restored from and to a tape using this command. In this, files and directories are generally compressed into tarballs, an archive file. For this purpose, it is among the most widely used commands. Furthermore, the tarball can be easily moved from one server to another.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">Name the command that is used to compare the strings in a shell script.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">To compare text strings, use the test command. By comparing each character in each string, the test command usually compares text strings.  In most cases, tests are generally included as a conditional execution of shell commands. It can be used for:

            • Comparison of file attributes
            • Comparison of strings
            • Comparing basic arithmetic operations
            
            Using square brackets ([ and ]) around the EXPRESSION is equivalent to testing it with the test. 
            
            <b>Syntax of test command:</b>
            
            • test EXPRESSION
            • test EXPRESSION &amp;&amp; true-command
            • test EXPRESSION || false-command
            • test EXPRESSION &amp;&amp; true-command || false-command
            
            <b>Examples:</b>  
            
            • test 50 -gt 40 &amp;&amp; echo "Yes" || echo "No"
            
            Because 50 is greater than 40, this command prints the text "Yes".
            
            • ["Excellent" = "Excellent"]; echo $?
            
            As the two strings are identical, this command prints "0" because the expression is true.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">In shell scripting, you can use three looping statements as given below:

            • while statement
            • for statement
            • until statement
            
            <b>Syntax is as follows:</b>
            
            • <b>For Loop</b>: Loops that operate on lists of items are known as loops. Each item in the list receives the same set of commands.
            
            <b>Syntax</b>: 
            <code>
             for var in word1 word2 ... wordN 
            do   
                    Statement to be executed  
            done
            </code>

            <b>Example</b>: 
            <code>
            for a in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
            do 
                if [ $a == 3 ]

            Iteration no 2
            </code> 
            
            • <b>While Loop</b>: It involves evaluating a command first and then executing a loop based on the result. The loop will be terminated if the command raises to false.
            
            <b>Syntax</b>:  
            <code>
            while command 
            do 
                Statement to be executed 
            done
            </code>

            <b>Example:</b>
            <code>
            a=0 
            while [ $a -lt 3 ]

                a=`expr $a + 1` 
            done

            2 
            3 
            </code>

            • <b>Until Loop</b>: As often as the condition/command evaluates to false, the until loop is executed. Once the condition or command becomes true, the loop terminates.
            
            <b>Syntax</b>: 
            <code>
            until command 
            do  
                     Statement to be executed until command is true

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">The SUID (Set User ID) bit is known as the "s" bit. SUIDS are special file permissions for executable files that enable other users to run the file as the file owner. There will be an s (to indicate SUID) special permission for the user instead of the normal x, which represents execute permissions. A file that has the "s" bit set will grant the process the rights of the file's owner while the program is running.

            <b>Example: </b>
            
            Executing the "passwd" command to change the password, for example, allows the user to write the new password to the shadow file even though its owner is "root".</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">• <b>sed Command</b>: sed command is an acronym for stream editor. It is used for editing a file without using an editor. The SED command performs a variety of operations on files, such as searching, finding and replacing, inserting and deleting. However, substitution or find and replace are the most commonly used features of SED.
            
            <b>Syntax</b>: sed options file 
            
            <b>Example</b>: Execution over Shell Interpreter/Editor
            
            <code>/u/user1/Shell_Scripts_2020&gt; echo "Hi Gourav" | sed 's/Hi/Hello/' </code>

            In this case, “s” command in sed replaces the string Hi with “Hello”. 
            
            <b>Output</b>: 
            <code>Hello Gourav</code>
            
            • <b>awk Command</b>: The command is a scripting language generally used to manipulate data and generate reports. There is no need to compile it and users are allowed to have access to a variable, string functions, numeric functions, and logical operations.
            
            <b>Syntax</b>: awk options File Name 
            
            <b>Example</b>: Script/Code
            
            <code>/u/user1/Shell_Scripts_2017&gt; cat &gt; script10 
            Hello Aisha 
            Hello Rohan 
            Hello Gourav </code>

            An awk command/utility assigns variables in following way: 
            
            $0 -&gt; For whole line (e.g. Hello Aisha)  
            
            $1 -&gt; For the first field i.e. Hello  
            
            $2 -&gt; For the second field 
            
            <b>Execution over Shell Interpreter/Editor </b>
            
            <code>awk ‘{print $0}’ script10 </code>

            The above script prints all the 3 lines completely.

In shells, they're called regular expressions.  A character that is neither a letter nor a number is generally considered a metacharacter. Using shell metacharacters, you can group together commands, redirect and pipe input/output, put commands in the background, reduce the size of file names and path names, etc. You can use them as wildcards to specify a file name without typing in the file's full name. The most common metacharacters are as follows:

            • <b>Asterisk (*)</b>: Use the * to match any character.
            • <b>Question Mark (?)</b>: It matches a single character in the filename.
            • <b>Brackets ([…])</b>:  The metacharacters used here match some specified characters.
            • <b>Hyphen (-)</b>: When placed within [] (brackets), the - metacharacter matches a specified range.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Using the Uptime command, you can see how long your system has been active. You can also determine the number of users with running sessions, and the average system load for 1, 5, and 15 minutes. The information displayed at once can also be filtered based on your specified options. 

            <b>Example: $ uptime   </b>
            
            Entering the above command at the shell prompt, namely $ uptime, will produce the following output:
            
            9:21am  up 86 day(s), 11:46,  3 users,  load average: 2.24, 2.18, 2.16</p>

Using the Grep command, one can search in a file for patterns. Grep command have the following syntax:
            <b>grep “literal string” <filename></filename></b>
            
            <b>Example: </b>
            <code>
            grep “apple” file1.txt                     //Displays all the lines with the word “apple” in the file1
            
            grep “apple” file1.txt  file2.txt   //Scan multiple documents and search the word “apple” in both files.
            </code>

            • <b>Find command</b>: The FIND command searches for files and folders based on their size, modification time, and access time. You can use this command to search files and directories. Find command have the following syntax:
            <b>find <path> <search criteria=""> <action></action></search></path></b>
            
            <b>Example:</b>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">How can we create a function in shell script?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">In other programming languages, shell functions are much like subroutines, procedures, and functions. The syntax for declaring a function is as follows:
            <code>
            function_name () 
            { 
               list of commands
            } 
            </code>
            Function_name is the name of your function, and that's what you'll use to call it from anywhere in your script. The function name must be followed by parentheses, then a list of commands enclosed in braces.
            
            <b>Example</b>:
            
            The following example shows how function can be used:
            <code>
            #!/bin/sh
            # Define your function here
             
            Hello () 
              {
                 echo "Hello World"
              }
             
            # Invoke your function
            Hello
            </code>

            The following output will be displayed after execution:
            <code>
            $./test.sh
            Hello World
            </code></p>

                    </div>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">How to use pipe commands?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Pipe command allows you to use several commands in the same way, in which the output of one is used as input for another. Like a pipeline, each process output is directly input to the next one. A pipe is represented by the symbol "|". The flow of data through a pipeline is unidirectional, i.e., from left to right.

            <b>Syntax</b>:
            
            <code>command_1 | command_2 | command_3 | .... | command_N</code></p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Shell is an interface between the user and the kernel. Even though there can be only one kernel; a system can have many shell running simultaneously. So, whenever a user enters a command through the keyboard, the shell communicates with the kernel to execute it and then display the output to the user.</p>

Shell Scripting is a program to write a series of commands for the shell to execute. It can combine lengthy and repetitive sequences of commands into a single and simple script that can be stored and executed anytime which, reduces programming efforts.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">We can use utilities like “ftp,” “scp” or “rsync” to copy a file from one machine to other.

            E.g., Using ftp:
            
            FTP hostname
            
            &gt;put file1

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">We can use tail –f filename. This will cause only the default last 10 lines to be displayed on std o/p which continuously shows the updating part of the file.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">We can use ssh to do this:

            ssh username@serverIP -p sshport
            
            Example

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is Git?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and is used to help coordinate work among several people on a project while tracking progress over time. In other words, it’s a tool that facilitates source code management in software development.
    
            Git favors both programmers and non-technical users by keeping track of their project files. It enables multiple users to work together and handles large projects efficiently.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What do you understand by the term ‘Version Control System’?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A version control system (VCS) records all the changes made to a file or set of data, so a specific version may be called later if needed.
    
            This helps ensure that all team members are working on the latest version of the file</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">• Local version control systems have a database that stores all file changes under revision control on disc in a special format.
            • Centralized version control systems have a single repository, from which each user receives their working copy.
            • Distributed version control systems contain multiple repositories, and different users can access each one with their working copy.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A Git merge conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to resolve the differences in code between the two commits automatically. 
    
            Git is capable of automatically merging the changes only if the commits are on different lines or branches.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Here are the steps that will help you resolve conflicts in Git:
    
            • Identify the files responsible for the conflicts.
            • Implement the desired changes to the files 
            • Add the files using the git add command.
            • The last step is to commit the changes in the file with the help of the git commit command.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">There are two processes through which you can revert a commit:
    
            1. Remove or fix the bad file in a new commit and push it to the remote repository. Then commit it to the remote repository using:
            
            <code>git commit –m “commit message”</code>
            
            2. Create a new commit to undo all the changes that were made in the bad commit. Use the following command:
            
            <code>git revert <commit id=""></commit></code></p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Let’s say you're a developer and you want to switch branches to work on something else. The issue is you don’t want to make commits in uncompleted work, so you just want to get back to this point later. The solution here is the Git stash. 
    
            Git stash takes your modified tracked files and saves it on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time. To go back to the work you can use the <code>stash pop</code>.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is the difference between Git and other revision control systems?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">• Git is a distributed revision control system, which means that it can be used without a central server. This allows for a great deal of flexibility in how projects are managed. 
            • On the other side, revision control systems are often centralized, which can limit the flexibility of how projects are managed.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">How does Git work?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Git works by tracking changes to files in a repository. When a file is changed, Git calculates a unique identifier for the change, called a "commit hash". The commit hash allows Git to identify the change and track it over time.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">To use Git, a developer first creates a local repository on their computer. This repository contains all the files for a project and the history of all the changes made to those files. 
    
            Or just follow the instructions in the Git documentation (https://git-scm.com/doc).</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Some of the most important Git commands are "commit", "push", and "pull". 
    
            • The <code>commit</code> command is used to save changes to the local repository. 
            • And the <code>push</code> command is used to send changes to the remote repository. 
            • Then the <code>pull</code> command is used to retrieve changes from the remote repository.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Some of the most important features of Git are its distributed nature, its ability to track changes, and its support for branches.
    
            • The distributed nature of Git allows developers to work independently and offline. 
            • The ability to track changes helps developers to keep track of their work and revert to previous versions if necessary. 
            • The support for branches allows developers to experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A branch is a way to isolate development work on a particular aspect of a project. When a branch is created, it diverges from the primary branch. It allows developers to work on a new feature or bug fix without affecting the main codebase.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Conflict in Git occurs when two or more developers have made changes to the same part of a file, and those changes can't be automatically merged. When this happens, Git will mark the file as conflicted and leave it up to the developers to resolve the conflict. 
    
            Resolving a conflict can be done by manually editing the file to choose which changes should be kept, or by using a tool like Git's merge command to automatically merge the changes.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">The git status command is used to obtain the current state of a Git repository. This command can be used to determine whether the repository is clean or dirty, and to see which files have been modified. The git status command will also show which branch is currently checked out and whether there are any uncommitted changes.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">There are many reasons that Git is considered an easy tool to work with. 
    
            • It has a straightforward learning curve. Even those new to programming can easily learn how to use Git with just a few hours of practice. 
            • Git is highly flexible and can be easily customized to fit the needs of any project. 
            • And, Git is very stable and reliable, so users can trust that their work will be safe and sound.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Git stash is a powerful tool that allows you to save your changes and revert your working directory to a previous state. This is especially useful when switching branches or reverting to a previous commit.
    
            And Git Stash takes a snapshot of your changes and stores them away for later use.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Both of these commands will fetch any new commits from the remote repository, but they differ in how they handle these commits.
    
            Git pull will merge the remote commits into the current branch, while git fetch will simply retrieve the commits and store them in the local repository. This means that if you have any uncommitted changes, git pull may result in merge conflicts, while git fetch will not.</p>

            • Git is a version control system that lets you track changes to your code. 
            • GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. You can use GitHub to store your code remotely, or you can use it to collaborate with other developers on a project.</p>

            • The first is to simply commit your changes before switching branches. This will ensure that your changes are saved to a specific branch, and you won't have to worry about them being lost when you switch branches.
            • Another way to avoid detached HEAD is to use the <code>git checkout</code> command with the "<b>-b</b>" option.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">To resolve a conflict in Git, you will need to first identify the source of the conflict. Once you have identified the source of the conflict, you can use the "git pull" command. This will pull the latest changes from the remote repository and merge them with your local copy. 
    
            If the "git pull" command doesn't resolve the conflict, you can try the "git merge" command. This will merge the two versions of the code manually. You will need to resolve the conflicts manually and then commit the merged code.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Subgit is a tool for managing Git repositories with Subversion history. It allows you to keep your existing subversion history while moving to Git, and it also provides a way to keep your Git history synchronized with subversion.
    
            There are many reasons that you might want to use Subgit, 
            
            • For example, if you have a large subversion repository with a lot of history, moving to Git can be a huge undertaking; that's where Subgit can help transition smoother. 
            • And if you work in an environment where subversion is the primary version control system, using Subgit can help you keep your Git history in sync with the rest of the team.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">There are two stages when a merge can enter a conflicted stage.
    
            1. Starting the merge process
            
            If there are changes in the working directory of the stage area in the current project, the merge will fail to start. In this case, conflicts happen due to pending changes that need to be stabilized using different Git commands.
            
            2. During the merge process
            
            The failure during the merge process indicates that there’s a conflict between the local branch and the branch being merged. In this case, Git resolves as much as possible, but some things have to be fixed manually in the conflicted files.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">In Git, squashing commits means combining two or more commits into one.
    
            Use the below command to write a new commit message from the beginning.
            
            <code>git reset -soft HEAD~N &amp;&amp;git commit</code>
            
            But, if you want to edit a new commit message and add the existing commit messages, then you must extract the messages and pass them to Git commit.
            
            The below command will help you achieve this: 
            
            <code>git reset -soft HEAD~N &amp;&amp;git commit -edit -m“$(git log -format=%B -reverse .HEAD@{N})”</code></p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Git merge is used to incorporate new commits into your feature branch.
            • Git merge creates an extra merge commit every time you need to incorporate changes.
            • It pollutes your feature branch history.
    
            As an alternative to merging, you can rebase the feature branch into master.
    
            • Git rebase incorporates all the new commits in the master branch.
            • It rewrites the project history by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original branch</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">To recover a deleted branch, first, you can use the <code>git reflog</code> command. It will list the local recorded logs for all the references. Then, you can identify the history stamp and recover it using the <code>git checkout</code> command.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">The Git stash drop command is used to remove a particular stash. If there’s a stash you're no longer using or you want to remove a specific item of stash from the list, you can use the stash commands.
    
            Let’s say you want to delete an item named stash@{abc}; you can use the command:
            
            <code>git stash drop stash@{abc}</code></p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">• The revert command in Git is used to create a new commit that undoes the changes made in the previous commit. When you use this command, a new history is added to the project; the existing history is not modified.
            • Git reset is a command that is used to undo the local changes that have been made to a Git repository. Git reset operates on the following: commit history, the staging index, and the working directory.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">There are two commands to determine these two different things.
    
            <code>git branch --merged</code> - Returns the list of branches that have been merged into the current branch.

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">The command git cherry-pick enables you to pick up commits from a branch within a repository and apply it to another branch. This command is useful to undo changes when any commit is accidentally made to the wrong branch. Then, you can switch to the correct branch and use this command to cherry-pick the commit.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">How is Docker different from standard virtualization using VMs?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Virtual Machines (VMs) virtualize the underlying hardware. They run on physical hardware via an intermediation layer known as a hypervisor. They require additional resources are required to scale-up VMs.
            
            They are more suitable for monolithic applications. Whereas, Docker is operating system level virtualization. Docker containers userspaceace on top the of host kernel, making them lightweight and fast. Up-scaling is simpler, just need to create another container from an image.
            
            Generally, Docker is more suitable for Microservices based cloud applications.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What are the major components of Docker Architecture?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">The four major components of Docker are daemon, Client, Host, and Registry
            
            • <b>Docker daemon:</b> It is also referred to as ‘dockerd’ and it accepts Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. It can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.
            • <b>Docker Client:</b> It is the predominant way that enables Docker users to interact with Docker. It sends the docker commands to docked, which actually executes them using Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.
            • <b>Docker Registry:</b> It hosts the Docker images and is used to pull and push the docker images from the configured registry. Docker Hub is the public registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default. However, it is always recommended for organizations to use own private registry.
            • <b>Docker Host:</b> It is the physical host (VM) on which Docker Daemon is running and docker images and containers are created.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is a Volume in docker?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A data volume is a specially-designated directory that is located outside of the root filesystem of a container (i.e. created on the host), designed to persist data, independent of the container’s life cycle. This allows sharing data within containers by importing volume directory in other containers.
            
            Data volumes provide several useful features:
            
            • Data volumes persist even if the container itself is deleted.
            • Data volumes can be shared and reused among containers.
            • Changes to a data volume can be made directly.
            • Volumes can be initialized when a container is created.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">When is .dockerignore file used?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A typical Dockerfile contains one or more COPY commands to copy files and/or folders from the developer machine to the docker image, which eventually become part of the container. While copying folders to a docker image, it is quite possible that some unwanted files are also copied to the image. This may create a bulky image and hence cause performance issues in the container.
            
            In order to avoid this, we can create a file named .dockerignore along with Dockerfile in the same directory. This file is used to list all the files and directories that need to be excluded while copying folders onto the image. It contains a pattern and none of the files matching it is added to the image. This helps to avoid unnecessarily sending large or sensitive files and directories to the daemon and potentially adding them to images.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is docker-compose?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Compose is a tool provided by Docker for defining and running multi-container applications together in an isolated environment. Either a YAML or JSON file can be used to configure all the required services like Database, Messaging Queue along with the application server. Then, with a single command, we can create and start all the services from the configuration file.
            
            It comes handy to reproduce the entire application along with its services in various environments like development, testing, staging and most importantly in CI as well.
            
            Typically the configuration file is named as docker-compose.yml. Below is a sample file:
            
            <code>version: '3'
            services:
              app:
                image: appName:latest
                build: .
                ports:          
                - "8080"   
                depends_on:
                  - oracledb
                restart: on-failure:10    
              oracledb:
                image: db:latest 
                volumes:
                  - /opt/oracle/oradata
                ports:       
                  - "1521"</code></p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is Docker Hub?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images. The default version of Hub is the cloud-based registry that hosts all the public docker images like Ubuntu, Linux, etc.
            
            We need to create repositories to push and pull the docker images, allowing us to share container images within our team, organization, customers. In the case of public repositories, we can share the images with the entire Docker community.
            
            Docker images are pushed to Docker Hub through the ‘docker push’ command. A single Docker Hub repository can hold many Docker images.
            
            It also allows you to link repositories with GitHub in order to automate building, testing and deploying of our application images. It provides a centralized resource for container image discovery, distribution and change management, collaboration and workflow automation throughout the development pipeline.
            
            We can also use third-party Repository tools like Nexus and JFrog Artifactory to store and manage docker images.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Everything starts with the Dockerfile. The Dockerfile is the source code of the Image.
            Once the Dockerfile is created, you build it to create the image of the container. The image is just the "compiled version" of the "source code" which is the Dockerfile.
            
            Once you have the image of the container, you should redistribute it using the registry. The registry is like a git repository -- you can push and pull images.
            
            Next, you can use the image to run containers. A running container is very similar, in many aspects, to a virtual machine (but without the hypervisor).</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What are the steps involved while using Docker for application development?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">All the steps below are based on the prerequisite that Docker is already installed on the machine:
            
            • <b>Create Dockerfile:</b>
            The initial step is to create a Dockerfile file using a suitable base image along with all the required steps/commands, like setting environment variables, adding application jar, etc. This creates several layers on the existing base image.
            
            • <b>Build image:</b>
            Once the Dockerfile is ready, we can either use docker command or via a Gradle task to generate a docker image. This image contains all the application dependencies required to run the application in a container.
            
            <code>docker build -t-test/security tool.</code>

            • <b>Run the image:</b>
            Once the docker image is built, we can create and start the container using command.
            
            <code>docker run --name rest_tool test/security tool.</code>

            • <b>Start Containers using Compose:</b>
            In case we have multiple containers constituting an application like database, messaging queue, etc.; then it is advisable to use docker-compose to run multiple containers simultaneously. It is also useful in the CI pipeline for running the application and performing tests.
            
            <code>docker-compose up</code>

            • <b>Test the Application:</b>
            After the containers are up and running, the application is ready for Integration or Acceptance tests to be performed. Ideally, it is integrated into the CI pipeline for determining if the new code changes are affecting the existing flows.
            
            • <b>Push image:</b>
            Typically in a container-based development environment, the deliverable artifact is a docker image. This image needs to be published to an internal Registry like Artifactory so that it can be propagated to next levels like Continuous Delivery and Deployment pipelines.
            
            <code>docker push test/securityTool</code>

            • <b>Production orchestration:</b>
            Ideally, organizations need to use orchestration tools like Kubernetes to run the containers in a Pod to perform load balancing, service discovery, etc in a production environment. It also helps in providing scalability and high availability of the application.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What are containers?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A container is a standalone unit of software that packages together applications with all its dependencies and configurations. Containers help in abstracting applications from the computing environment in which they run.  Containers help in running the applications correctly in various computing environments. This helps to resolve the biggest problem “ It doesn’t work in my system. Multiple containers in an isolated manner can co-exist in a host system. All containers share the common host operating system. Thus making the containers lightweight and more preferable than virtual machines.
            
            Detaching applications from its environment helps container-based applications to be deployed faster and on any on-premise systems or cloud. Developers with the help of containers can now concentrate on how to develop an application rather than how to run an application on different environments.IT operations teams focus on deployment and management rather than with application details such as specific software versions and configurations. Main competitors for containers are the virtual machines. Virtual machines are not lightweight compared to containers.
            
            Containerization as a strategy is used as a practice across digital transformation due to its capability to bring a DevOps culture. The Dockerfile which defines the configuration of the image also acts as Infra as code up to some extent. Thus enabling teams to abstract their infrastructure in the form of code.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">Why do we need containers? Give at least 3 reasons.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Containers is a virtualization technique which is based on the operating system resources. Multiple containers share the same host operating system. The main advantages are:
            
            • <b>Consistent and Reliable Environment</b>
            Containers help to achieve a stable environment that helps the application to run reliably. All dependencies like libraries etc needed for the applications are packaged into the containers. Containers can also include dependencies like specific versions of programming languages and other software libraries. Containers, in turn, increases the productivity of the developers and operations teams as they can concentrate more on the actual application rather than debugging different computing environments. This also creates fewer bugs for  the developers and IT operations teams.
            
            • <b>Run Anywhere</b>
            Containers can run anywhere-
            
            1. Across different operating system whether it be a Linux, Windows or Mac system. or a developer  
            2. Available across different service providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.
            3. Can be used across different environments like development, test, pre-production, production, etc.
            
            • <b>Isolation</b>
            Since the containers virtualize  OS resources like file systems developers get an isolated sandbox from other applications using containers. The container itself acts as a full-fledged system providing this isolation.
            
            • <b>From Code to Applications (Infrastructure As Code)</b>
            Applications along with its dependencies are packaged into the containers which could be versioned. This helps easy management and leading to greater agility and productivity.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is Docker?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Docker is an open source container platform, from Docker, Inc launched in 2013. Docker enables operating system level virtualization. Docker is available as free and enterprise version. Docker containers, unlike Virtual Machines, share the same host operating system. It has less overhead compared to VM’s. Docker created the industry guidelines for containers, making it more portable and secure. Docker is having the best isolation capability that is beneficial when more containers run on the same host system. Docker could be run on any system on-premises or cloud. Using docker we can create, start, stop, move, pause, unpause or delete a container.
            
            A Docker container can connect to one or more networks, attach storage to it, and even create a new image depending on the current state of the container. Docker also helps in controlling how the containers are isolated from other containers or host machine. Dockerfile in docker platform helps to achieve infrastructure as code thus enabling consistent and reliable computing environment. This reduces a lot of configuration and infrastructure related defects that would improve the quality of applications.  
            
            Docker is supported on all the latest technologies like Google Cloud Platform and by Google Kubernetes Engine. Docker was primarily developed for Linux systems but now also supports Windows and Mac Os.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What are the container platforms available other than docker?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">According to 2018 reports Docker is the most popular container platform constituting 83% of container space. It’s preferred because of the ease with which the user can work with. Docker also provides greater isolation between the containers on the same host operating system. Few of the other popular ones are CoreOS rkt
            
            12 percent of production containers were rkt (pronounced “Rocket”) from CoreOS. rkt supports two types of images: Docker and appc. The main advantage of rkt is its usage with Kubernetes.In Kubernetes, an rkt container runtime can be declared as
            
            <code>“ kubelet --container-runtime=rkt”.</code>

            Compared with Docker, rkt has fewer third-party integrations. Red Hat recently acquired CoreOS. Application Container Image or appc is defined by the App Container spec. An ACI contains all necessary files to execute an application and an image.
            
            • <b>Mesos Containerizer</b>
            4 percent of production containers were Mesos from Apache. Mesos supports both Docker and appc image types. It works better with the frameworks of big data applications.  Mesos is not a standalone container and requires the Mesos framework to make it run.
            
            • <b>LXC Linux Containers</b>
            1 percent of containers were LXC Linux Containers. LXC also has a great active community around it. The main disadvantage of LXC is its incompatibility with Kubernetes.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What are the basic actions performed on the docker container?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Basic actions on Docker containers are:
            
            • <b>Create a docker container</b>
            Following command creates the docker container with the required images.
            
            <code>docker create --name [container-name] [image-name]</code>
            
            • <b>Run docker container</b>
            Following command helps  to execute the container
            
            <code>docker run -it -d --name [container-name] [image-name] bash</code>
            
            Main steps involved in the run command is
            
            1. Pulls the image from Docker Hub if it’s not present in the running environment
            2. Creates the container.
            3. The file system is allocated and is mounted on a read/write layer.
            4. A network interface is allocated that allows docker to talk to the host.
            5. Finds an available IP address from pool.
            6. Runs our application in our case “bash” shell.
            7. Captures application outputs
            
            • <b>Pause container</b>
            Processes running inside the container is paused. Following command helps us to achieve this.
            
            <code>docker pause [container-id/name]</code>

            Container can’t be removed if in a paused state.
            
            • <b>Unpause container</b>
            Unpause moves the container back to run the state. Below command helps us to do this.
            
            <code>docker unpause [container-id/name]</code>
            
            • <b>Start container</b>
            If container is in a stopped state, container is started.
            
            <code>docker start [container-id/name]</code>
            
            • <b>Stop container</b>
            Container with all its processes is stopped with below command.
            
            <code>docker stop [container-id/name]</code>

            To stop all the running Docker containers use the  below command
            
            <code>docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)</code>
            
            • <b>Restart container</b>
            Container along with its processes are restarted
            
            <code>docker restart [container-id/name]</code>
            
            • <b>Kill container</b>
            A container can be killed with below command
            
            <code>docker kill [container-id/name]</code>
            
            • <b>Destroy container</b>
            The entire container is discarded. It is preferred to do this when the container is in a stopped state rather than do it forcefully.
            
            <code>docker rm [container-id/name]</code></p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What are the disadvantages of Docker?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Like any other technologies, Docker has its own advantages and disadvantages. Docker is not a silver bullet and needs care in architecting and orchestrating docker containers keeping below points in mind.
            
            • Docker is not so fast compared to bare metal servers. Even though containers are lightweight and so easy to boot up it is subjected to decreased network performance. Performance of the containers are affected as a single operating system caters to multiple containers.
            • <b>Integrability:</b> Even though Docker is open source some of the container products don’t work with all. This may be due to the competition prevailing in the market. For eg:  OpenShift which is a container-as-a-service platform from Red Hat, only works with the Kubernetes.
            • <b>Data loss in containers:</b> When the container exits the data will be lost. Data could be saved through volume mounting like Docker Data Volumes but more hard work needs to be done in this space.
            • <b>Poor or no GUI:</b> Containers were used mainly for deploying server application that doesn't require GUI. There are some methods to run GUI app inside containers but it’s somewhat clumsy these days.
            • <b>More suitable for applications that use microservices:</b> Generally the docker’s benefit is to ease the application delivery by providing a packaging mechanism but the true benefit comes when we use microservices.
            • There are other virtualization techniques like unikernels which is based on library operating systems. Unikernels provide improved security, more optimisation and boots faster.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is docker image?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A Docker image is an executable file, that creates a Docker container. An image is built from the executable version of an application together with its dependencies and configurations. Running instance of an image is a container.
            
            Docker image includes system libraries, tools, and other files and dependencies for the application. An image is made up of multiple layers. Layered structure helps the developers to reuse already available static image layers from the Docker Hub, for different projects. This saves the developers time. Each image has a base layer which could be already available in Docker Hub or built from scratch. Then a readable/writable layer over the static layer is created that helps to customise the container. Each layer of the docker image could be verified in /var/lib/docker/aufs/diff, or via the Docker history command.
            
            Storage drivers are used to managing the image layers. A writable layer created while creating the container is called the container layer. Multiple containers can share the same base layer and have their own writable layer. Few commands that can be used with images are:
            
            • docker history shows the history of an image and its layers.
            • docker update helps to update the container configurations.
            • docker tag creates a tag for the container and organizes container images.
            • docker search looks for the image in Docker Hub
            • docker save allows saving of images.
            • docker rmi removes one or multiple images.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is the difference between ADD and COPY in Dockerfile?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">The ADD instruction is used to copy files from build context to the image. Apart from regular files, it also allows URL and archive (tar, gzip, etc) files as the <source> parameter.
            
            When a URL is provided, a file is downloaded from the URL and copied to the <destination>.It automatically unpacks compressed files, if the <source> argument is a local file in a recognized compression format (tar, gzip, bzip2, etc).
            
            Whereas COPY does a straight-forward, as-is copy of files and folders from the build context into the container. It doesn't support URLs or gives any special treatment to archives.
            
            Anything that you want to COPY into the container must be present in the local build context. The recommendation from the Docker team is to use COPY in almost all cases.</destination></p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is the difference between ENTRYPOINT and CMD in Dockerfile?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">ENTRYPOINT is a definition in Dockerfile that specifies a command that will always be executed when the container starts. It allows us to configure a command along with its parameters that will run as an executable in a container. Even if we do not specify any ENTRYPOINT, we may inherit it from the base image specified using the FROM keyword in your Dockerfile. Most of the official Docker base images have an ENTRYPOINT of /bin/sh or /bin/bash.
            
            To override the ENTRYPOINT at runtime, we can use --entrypoint.
            
            Whereas, the main purpose of a CMD is to provide defaults for an executing container. These defaults can include an executable or for executing an ad-hoc command in a container. It can omit the executable as well, in which case we must specify an ENTRYPOINT instruction as well specified with the JSON array format.
            
            The thumb rule is that every Dockerfile should specify at least one of CMD or ENTRYPOINT commands.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">How is Kubernetes related to Docker?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Though Docker is a great tool for quick development and environment setup, it cannot be used in production directly. It needs a layer of orchestration for container management.
            
            That’s where Kubernetes comes into the picture. Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for Docker containers. It manages containerized applications across multiple hosts and provides basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.
            
            In a Kubernetes environment, one or more docker containers are run inside a ‘pod’. A pod is a basic unit that Kubernetes deals with and it represents one or more containers that should be controlled as a single "application".</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Swarm is the native way provided by docker for implementing clusters for Docker containers. Basically, it allows a group of machines that are running Docker to join as a single cluster. Docker commands executed on a cluster are implemented on all the hosts by the swarm manager. Machines in a swarm can either be physical or virtual. After joining a swarm, they are referred to as nodes.
            
            It also provides built-in load balancing and Service Discovery for the applications running as containers.
            
            However, a more popular way of implementing clustering in production is achieved using Kubernetes. It is technically superior to Docker Swarm as it provides better health checking provisions at the pod level, better container scheduling and scaling.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A Chef is a Configuration Management tool which is primarily used by admins and DevOps teams to manage the application environments, web-server configuration, databases, and load balancers. Instructions are created in the form of recipes, that defines the components in the infrastructure and how those components can be deployed, configured and managed. In a nutshell, it makes it automates the rolling out of changes to various environments or machines.
            
            Whereas Docker is a way to package code into consistent units of work known as containers. These units of work can then be deployed to development, QA and production environments with far greater ease and consistency.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Continuous Integration is a mechanism used to enable DevOps methodology in development process i.e. helps to obtain immediate feedback on the changes made in the code by executing unit and acceptance tests, as soon as the code changes are checked-in to the repository.
            
            A typical process involves developers merging their changes to the branch as often as possible and they are validated by building, running and executing automated tests against the application.
            
            Docker plays a key role in enabling CI, as it can seamlessly integrate with any popular CI tools like Jenkins or TeamCity. Also, several Gradle plugins like Palantir, trans mode are available for automating the docker build and publish images by creating respective Gradle tasks.
            
            We can then define stages in Jenkins to perform tasks like building Docker images, starting containers using compose and executing Acceptance tests to validate the application changes.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">Why Docker is chosen compared to other container platforms?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">1. Docker has a huge user base in comparison with its competitors. According to a recent report, by an infrastructure monitoring tool company, it claims 25 % of companies are already using containerization technology. Out of which 83 % of containers are docker containers. This user base includes big banks, manufacturing companies, large product firms, etc.  Hence Docker is the most popular option to choose from the existing container technologies.
            2. Docker being an open source technology enjoys huge community support and hence it has been the most preferred containerization tool in the industry. Docker was primarily developed for Linux but now supports Windows and Mac OS environments.
            3. There is no container limitation on running Docker as the underlying could be anything like a laptop/cloud system. It only depends on the host system’s OS resources.
            4. Docker HUB forms the repository of docker images. Docker Hub users can upload and download the docker images. A lot of applications are released as docker images which enable reusability and interoperability.  
            5. Docker is extensively documented technology available in the containerization space. That makes it easy for even the first time users to work with it.
            6. Docker works very well with  Google Cloud Platform and by Google Kubernetes Engine and across different cloud platform providers.  Docker is also well supported by other configuration management platforms like Chef, Ansible, Puppet, etc</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is Docker architecture?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Docker is having a  client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon. Docker daemon helps in building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can co-exist on the same system or on different systems. This client-daemon connection is done via REST API.
            
            • <b>The Docker daemon</b>
            The Docker daemon is also known as docker engine manages docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. Communication with other docker daemons also happens through this. Docker daemon is started by the command “dockerd”.Docker daemon talks with the kernel manages system calls for creation, running, destroying, etc of containers.
            
            • <b>The Docker client</b>
            The Docker client is the utility we use when we use commands such as docker run. The Docker client sends these requests to Docker daemon, which does the rest. One Docker client can connect with more than one Docker daemon.
            
            • <b>Docker registries</b>
            A Docker registry is where the Docker images are stored. Docker Hub is a public registry and docker searches for images on Docker Hub by default. Other registries are Docker Datacenter (DDC), which also includes the Docker Trusted Registry (DTR). Whenever docker pull or docker run commands are executed, the required images are pulled from the registry. We can also push the newly created docker images to Docker registry.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is Docker Swarm?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">From Docker Engine version 1.12 Docker swarm mode was introduced that creates a cluster of one or more Docker Engines. A swarm can have more than one node which could be either a  physical or virtual machines that run docker engine.
            
            Main Features are
            
            • <b>Cluster management:</b> Docker Swarm could be created using Docker CLI  where application services could be deployed.No need of any other clustering tools.
            • <b>Distributed design:</b> At deployment time, the Docker Engine handles any specialization at runtime. Both manager and worker nodes use the Docker Engine.
            • <b>Declarative method:</b> A declarative method is used for defining the desired state of various services. For example, an application with a web front end service could be combined with message queueing services and a database backend.
            • <b>Scaling:</b> Whenever we need to scale the swarm, one of the manager nodes automatically adapts by adding or removing tasks.
            • <b>The desired state attained:</b> The swarm manager node checks for the actual state and your expressed desired state to bring the cluster back to the desired state. For example, if a service needs to run 20 replicas of a container, and each worker machine hosting 10 of them, the manager always creates new ones to replace the replicas that crashed.
            • <b>Multi-host networking and service discovery:</b> The swarm manager assigns Ip addresses to the containers from the pool when it initializes or updates the application. Each service in the swarm has a unique DNS name and load balancer for the containers. Swarm helps the user to define how to distribute load balancing within service containers.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is developer workflow of docker?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">The workflow starts with:
            
            • <b>Attaining the docker image</b>
            If the docker image is present in Docker Hub or that kind of Docker registries the images are selected from them. Developers can also create a great number of images if need be. Images have a layered architecture. Mostly a combination of a base layer and then a customised layer is used to create a docker image. There are several types of files that help to build images and they are kept in respective repositories. Some of the important files to consider to create docker images are docker files, docker-compose.yml files, etc. Multiple containers could be run together using docker-compose.yml files. Some of the types of repositories where the images are stored are
            
            1. <b>Version Control</b> - This is used mainly used to store text-based files such as Dockerfiles, docker-compose.yml, and configuration files. Some of the version control systems are git, svn, Team Foundation Server, VSTS, and Clear Case.
            2. <b>Repository Manager</b> - Large binary files such as that of Maven/Java, npm, NuGet, and RubyGems are stored in repository managers.Whereas smaller binary files could be saved to version control. Examples include Nexus, Artifactory, and Archiva.
            3. <b>Package Repository</b> - Packaged applications for example like an operating system such as CentOS, Ubuntu, and Windows Server are stored in the package repository. Examples are yum, apt-get, and package management. They can also run several containers together described in a docker-compose.yml file and test the application.
            
            • <b>Deploy on UCP(Docker Universal control plane)</b>
            A CI/CD system runs unit tests, builds the applications, and create a  Docker image on the Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP). If the image passes all tests they are signed using Docker Content Trust and shipped to Docker Trusted Registry (DTR). The developer could also do testing on an integration environment on UCP in cases where the developer’s machine does not have access to all the resources to run the entire application.
            
            • <b>Push Images</b>
            Once the image is ready newer images created are pushed into Docker Trusted Registry. The developer can use the command
            
            <code>docker push [image name]</code>
            The developer account in DTR is a must have to do this action
            
            • <b>Commit</b>
            Once the application is tested on UCP files used to create the application, its images, and its configuration is committed to version control. The commit triggers could be set up to trigger the CI/CD workflow. The images could now be used to create containers.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What are Dockerfiles?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Dockerfile is a text file that has instructions to build a Docker image. All commands in dockerfile could also be used from the command line to build images.
            
            docker build command creates an image from the dockerfile and its contexts. Contexts are a set of files at a PATH/URL. URL could be any repository location of any version control system. PATH could also be a location in your local system. The following command shows building docker image from the contexts in the current directory and send the context to the docker daemon
            
            <code>$ docker build .
            Sending build context to Docker daemon  6.51 MB
            ...</code>

            Root directory or path is not preferred as context path because the entire contents of your hard drive will be transferred to the Docker daemon.
            
            Docker daemon performs a validation of the dockerfile before running instructions in dockerfile. Docker daemon takes on the instructions one by one creating an updated image each time.
            
            Sample Dockerfile :
            
            <code>FROM ubuntu:16.04
            COPY . /app
            RUN make /app
            CMD python /app/app.py</code>

            Each instruction in a dockerfile  creates one read-only layer:
            
            • FROM creates a layer from the ubuntu:16.04 Docker image as the base image.
            • COPY adds files or contexts from your Docker client’s current directory.
            • RUN builds your application. Here we use make.
            • CMD specifies the command to be run inside the container.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What are docker-compose.yml files?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Docker compose is a tool that helps to run multi-container docker applications. Compose uses docker-compose.yml which is a YAML file to configure application’s services. Compose workflow is a three-step process. First is to create a dockerfile to build the image, secondly define the services to be run on a container in the docker-compose.yml file and thirdly docker-compose up command starts up your entire applications. dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml files are similar but the main difference is that docker compose file manages multi-container architecture rather than a single container.
            
            Sample docker-compose.yml file looks like:
            
            <code>version: "7"
            services:
              testservice:
                # replace username/repo:tag with your name and image details
                image: <img name="" class="lozad">
                deploy:
                  replicas: 10
                  resources:
                    limits:
                      cpus: "0.2"
                      memory: 70M
                  restart_policy:
                    condition: on-failure
                ports:
                  - "9080:80"
                networks:
                  - webnet</code>

            This docker-compose.yml is reflected upon below:
            
            • Pull the image from Docker registry .
            • Run 10 instances of the pulled image as a service called testservice, with setting limits on each one as, 20% of a single core of CPU time and 70 MB of RAM.
            • Immediately restart containers on failure.
            • Map port 9080 on the host system to test services port 80.
            • Test services containers share port 80 through a load-balanced network called webnet.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is Docker volume mounting?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Data is not persistent inside a container. One of the most used methods is Volume mounting.  Another method for persisting data is to include data in the writable layer but that layer is tightly coupled with the host machine where the container is running, thus the data couldn’t be managed easily. Also writing into the writable layer is complex and needs to use a driver. 
            
            To retain data, the best-preferred way is to use a Docker volume mount where it mounts another directory into your container. This directory is on the host which could be seen within the container. The main advantage of volume mounting is
            
            • Easy to manage using Docker CLI commands.
            • We have support for both Windows and Linux systems
            • Multiple containers can share the volumes.
            • Volumes are easier to back up
            • Volume drivers are present to encrypt volume contents and to store on cloud systems etc
            • The container can pre-populate the new volumes with its contents
            • Volumes don't increase the size of the containers.
            
            Following commands could be used to manage volumes:
            
            • docker volume create <name> to create the volume
            • docker volume ls to list the volumes available to you
            • docker volume inspect <name> to get more details about the volume like path, drivers etc.
            • docker volume rm <name> to remove the container.
            • docker volume prune to remove unused volumes</name></name></name></p>

            • <b>Kernel namespaces</b>
            Namespaces define the context in which names are defined whether it be variable names or function names. In other words, namespace defines the scope of the names. For eg: namespaces are like surnames. Suppose we have two people with the same name “John “ their surname differentiates them.
            
            Each container in docker creates a set of namespaces specific to the container. Hence is the first and a great method of security between containers.
            
            • <b>Control Groups</b>
            Control groups facilitate resource accounting and limiting. Control Groups doesn’t allow a container to exhaust the host system’s CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc. It also doesn’t allow data and processes of container to be accessed by another container.
            
            • <b>Docker daemon attack surface</b>
            When a “docker run “ command is performed docker client speaks to docker daemon who manages the images and containers. Docker daemon needs root privileges. Extra precaution must be taken to give access only to trusted users to control docker daemon. A  container could even be started from the root directory on your host and the container can alter your host filesystem without any restriction.
            
            • <b>Linux Kernel Capabilities</b>
            Containers could be started with a reduced set of capabilities. This would mean that “root” within a container has fewer privileges than the real “root”. This, in turn, reduces the damage by an intruder with root privileges.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Built-in Public Key Infrastructure System helps to secure the deployment of container orchestration systems. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used in Public Key Infrastructure to communicate with other nodes in a swarm.
            
            When a swarm is initialized with “docker swarm init” command in a docker host, root Certificate Authority (CA) with a key pair is created. This is for securing nodes that join the particular swarm.
            
            “--external-ca”  flag is used with docker swarm init command to use external root CA.
            
            Manager node generates worker token and manager token. Each token has the digest of the root CA certificate and a randomly generated secret. When a new node joins the docker swarm with the worker token the node uses the digesting part to verify the root CA from the manager node. While the leader node uses the secret to approve the new joining node. Manager node issues a certificate to the joining node with a randomly generated node ID
            
            By default, swarm performs the renewal of the certificate every three months but it can be modified with the command
            
            “docker swarm update --cert-expiry <time period=""> “
            
            In case if the leader-manager node is down we can rotate the root CA within the swarm so that no nodes trust the certificate signed by old root CA. This can be done by the command “docker swarm ca --rotate”.
            
            This command thus creates a cross signed certificate telling the nodes that still trusted  old CA to start verification against new root CA</time></p>

            • <b>FROM instruction</b>
            
            Usage :
            
            <code>FROM [image] [AS [name]]</code>
            
            Or

            <code>FROM [image][@[digest]] [AS [name]]</code>
            
            FROM helps to set the base image for the following instructions in the Dockerfile. The base image could be one pulled from the remote public repository or a local image built by the user. FROM can appear multiple times in Dockerfile and each time it appears it clears any stage created from previous instructions. Hence usually an AS <name> is added to the FROM instruction to identify the last image created just before the FROM instruction.  
            
            • <b>RUN instruction</b>

            Usage:
            
            • RUN <command></command> (shell form, the command is run in a shell, which by default is /bin/sh -c on Linux or cmd /S /C on Windows)
            • RUN ["executable", "param1", "param2"] (exec form)
            
            RUN instruction creates a new layer on the current image which is used for the next step in Dockerfile.RUN cache is valid for the next build provided “docker build” command is not run with “--no-cache” flag.
            
            RUN in the executable form doesn’t do shell processing like variable substitution.
            
            • <b>CMD instruction</b>
            
            Usage:
            
            • CMD ["executable","param1","param2"] (exec form, this is the preferred form)
            • CMD ["param1","param2"] (as default parameters to ENTRYPOINT)
            • CMD command param1 param2 (shell form)
            
            CMD provides defaults for executing container. There could only be one CMD instruction but if there are many, only the last one has the effect. If CMD is providing default arguments for the ENTRYPOINT instruction, then the CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions should be specified with the JSON array format.  
            
            • <b>ADD instruction</b>
            
            Usage:
            
            • ADD [--chown=<user>:<group>] <src>... <dest>
            • ADD [--chown=<user>:<group>] ["<src>",... "<dest>"] (this form is required for paths containing whitespace)
            
            The ADD instruction copies new files, directories or remote file URLs from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the image at the path <dest>.
            
            • <b>COPY instruction</b>
            
            Usage:
            
            • COPY [--chown=<user>:<group>] <src>... <dest>
            • COPY [--chown=<user>:<group>] ["<src>",... "<dest>"] (this form is required for paths containing whitespace)
            
            The COPY instruction copies new files or directories from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the path <dest>.Main difference between COPY and ADD is that ADD supports the source to be a URL or tar file.
            
            • <b>ENTRYPOINT</b>
            
            Usage:
            
            • ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"] (exec form, preferred)
            • ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2 (shell form)
            
            An ENTRYPOINT allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable. As a best practice ENTRYPOINT should be defined when using the container as an executable and CMD should be used as a way of defining default arguments for an ENTRYPOINT command.CMD could be overridden while running a container with arguments.
            
            • <b>WORKDIR</b>
            
            Usage:
            
            • WORKDIR /path/to/workdir
            • The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY and ADD instructions in the Dockerfile.</dest></src></dest></src></group></user></dest></src></group></user></dest></src></dest></src></group></user></dest></src></group></user></name></p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Docker builds command builds the images from Dockerfiles and “context”.A build’s context is the set of files located in the specified PATH or URL. The PATH is a directory on your local host filesystem while the URL could be a Git repository location, pre-packaged tarball contexts, and plain text files. COPY instruction could be used to reference a file in the context.
            
            In the case of Git repositories, first the repository is pulled into a temporary directory on your local host then after it’s successful, the directory is sent to the Docker daemon as the context.
            
            <b>For eg:</b> docker build https://github.com/dockersample/test.git#container:docker uses a directory called docker in the branch container as the context.
            
            In the tarball context. <b>For eg:</b> docker build http://server/context.tar.gz   
            
            sends the URL itself to docker daemon.Tar file is downloaded on the host the Docker daemon is running on, which need not be the same host from which the build command is being issued.
            
            In text files context a single Dockerfile could be passed in the URL or pipe the file in via STDIN. For eg: To pipe a Dockerfile from STDIN we use the instruction: docker build - &lt; Dockerfile</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">While building a docker image Docker steps through the instructions in the Dockerfile adding layers to the base image. Every time Docker encounters a new instruction it checks for an existing image in its cache which it can reuse locally. Thus helping to build the final docker image quickly. If you don't want to use cache “ --no-cache=true” option with docker build command is used. Basic rules about cache are as follows:
            
            • After the parent image is in the cache, the next instruction is compared against all child images derived from that parent image to see if anyone of them was built using the next instruction. If not, the Docker builds the image at this step once again and the cache is invalidated.
            • For the ADD and COPY instructions, the contents of the file(s) in the image are examined and a checksum is calculated for each file. Last-modified and last-accessed times of the file(s) are not considered in these checksums. These checksums are compared with checksums of the existing images. If there are changes cache is invalidated.
            • Unlike the ADD and COPY commands, in the case of a RUN  command, the files updated in the container are not examined to determine if a cache hit exists. In that case, just the command string itself is used to find a match.
            • Once the cache is invalidated, all the following Dockerfile commands generate new images.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">When a Docker Swarm is created or a docker host joins the swarm two networks are created.
            
            • an overlay network called ingress, which manages control and data traffic related to swarm services. This is the default network unless the user specifies other user-defined overlay networks. User-defined overlay networks could be created by using the command “docker network create”ingress network facilitates load balancing among a service’s nodes.
            • To encrypt the application data traffic on a given overlay network, use the --opt encrypted flag on docker network create.
            • To attach a service to an existing overlay network, use the --network flag to docker service create, or the --network-add flag to docker service update command. Service containers connected to an overlay network can communicate with each other through it.
            • a bridge network called docker_gwbridge, which connects the Docker daemon to the other docker daemons in a swarm. docker_gwbridge connects the overlay networks (including the ingress network) to an individual Docker daemon’s physical network. It is a virtual bridge that exists in the kernel of the docker host. For customising the bridge network we have to do that before docker host joins the swarm or by temporarily removing the host from the swarm.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Types of volume mount in docker

            <img src="https://cdn-cllme.nitrocdn.com/fsJtPHuAIrjqkSrOmOGUpPSluVVKYWgR/assets/images/optimized/rev-c30b86b/media/images/1561456355095-Types-of-volume-mounts-in-docker.jpg" class="lozad">
            
            There are three mount types available in Docker   
            
            • Volume mounts are the best way to persist data in Docker. Data are stored in a part of the host filesystem which is managed by Docker containers. (/var/lib/docker/volumes/ on Linux).Main advantages of using volume mounts are
            
            • Easy to use and backup
            • Docker CLI commands or the Docker API can be used to manage volume mounts.
            • Linux and Windows containers support volume mounts.
            • Volumes could be shared securely among multiple containers.
            • New volumes can use pre-populated content by a container.
            
            Starting with Docker 17.06, -v or --volume flag and --mount flag could be used for docker swarm services and standalone containers. To create a docker volume. For eg:
            
            “docker volume create my-vol” creates new volume  “my-vol”.
            
            We can inspect a volume with the command “docker volume inspect”
            
            For eg:
            
            “docker volume inspect my-vol “ gives the output
            
            <code>[
            {
                "Driver": "local",
                "Labels": {},
                "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/my-vol/_data",
                "Name": "my-vol",
                "Options": {},
                "Scope": "local"
            }
            ]</code>

            If we need to start a container with “my-vol”
            
            • With -v flag

            “docker run -d  --name devtest -v my-vol:/app nginx:latest”. Here nginx images with the latest tag are executed with using volume mount “my-vol”
            
            • With --mount flag

            “docker run -d --name devtest --mount  source=my-vol,target=/app nginx:latest”
            
            • Bind mounts may be stored anywhere on the host system. A file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container unlike volume mounts where a new directory is created within Docker’s storage directory on the host machine, and Docker manages that directory’s contents. Non-Docker processes on the Docker host or a Docker container can modify them at any time.
            • tmpfs mounts are stored in the host system’s memory only and are never written to the host system’s file system. When the container stops, the tmpfs mount is removed, and files won’t persist.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">Explain the purpose of the .dockerignore file.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Whenever a “docker builds” command is executed we see a line that tells uploading context. This refers to the creation of a .tar file by including all files in the directory where the Dockerfile is present and uploading them to docker daemon. Consider if we are putting Dockerfile in home directory entire files in your home and in all subdirectories would be included in the creation of a .tar file. Thus before updating the context docker daemon checks for the .dockerignore file. All files that match the data in the .dockerignore file would be neglected. Hence sensitive information is not sent to the Docker daemon.
            
            sample .dockerignore file looks like this:
            
            <code># comment
            */temp*
            */*/temp*
            Temp?</code>
            
            This .dockerignore file ignores all files and directories whose names start with temp in any immediate subdirectory of the root or from any subdirectory that is two levels below the root. It also excludes files and directories in the root directory whose names are a one-character extension of temp. Everything that starts with # is ignored.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Docker is a very popular and powerful open-source containerization platform that is used for building, deploying, and running applications. Docker allows you to decouple the application/software from the underlying infrastructure.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A container is a standard unit of software bundled with dependencies so that applications can be deployed fast and reliably b/w different computing platforms.

            • Docker can be visualized as a big ship (docker) carrying huge boxes of products (containers).
            • Docker container doesn’t require the installation of a separate operating system. Docker just relies or makes use of the kernel’s resources and its functionality to allocate them for the CPU and memory it relies on the kernel’s functionality and uses resource isolation for CPU and memory, and separate namespaces to isolate the application’s view of the OS (operating system).

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">Why Learn Docker?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Application development is a lot more than just writing code! They involve a lot of behind-the-scenes things like usage of multiple frameworks and architectures for every stage of its lifecycle which makes the process more complex and challenging. Using the nature of containerization helps developers to simplify and efficiently accelerate the application workflow along with giving them the liberty to develop using their own choice of technology and development environments.

            • All these aspects form the core part of DevOps which becomes all the more important for any developer to know these in order to improve productivity, fasten the development along with keeping in mind the factors of application scalability and more efficient resource management.
            • Imagine containers as a very lightweight pre-installed box with all the packages, dependencies, software required by your application, just deploy to production with minimal configuration changes.
            • Lots of companies like PayPal, Spotify, Uber, etc use Docker to simplify the operations and to bring the infrastructure and security closer to make more secure applications.
            • Being portable, Containers can be deployed on multiple platforms like bare instances, virtual machines, Kubernetes platform etc. as per requirements of scale or desired platform.</p>

            • They share the kernel and system resources with other containers and run as isolated systems in the host operating system.
            • The main aim of docker containers is to get rid of the infrastructure dependency while deploying and running applications. This means that any containerized application can run on any platform irrespective of the infrastructure being used beneath.
            • Technically, they are just the runtime instances of docker images.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">Can you tell what is the functionality of a hypervisor?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A hypervisor is a software that makes virtualization happen because of which is sometimes referred to as the Virtual Machine Monitor. This divides the resources of the host system and allocates them to each guest environment installed.

            <img src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/myinterviewtrainer-domestic/public_assets/assets/000/000/100/original/Hypervisor.png?1615190592" class="lozad">

            • This means that multiple OS can be installed on a single host system. Hypervisors are of 2 types:
            
            1. <b>Native Hypervisor:</b> This type is also called a Bare-metal Hypervisor and runs directly on the underlying host system which also ensures direct access to the host hardware which is why it does not require base OS.
            2. <b>Hosted Hypervisor:</b> This type makes use of the underlying host operating system which has the existing OS installed.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">It is a YAML file consisting of all the details regarding various services, networks, and volumes that are needed for setting up the Docker-based application. So, docker-compose is used for creating multiple containers, host them and establish communication between them. For the purpose of communication amongst the containers, ports are exposed by each and every container.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A namespace is basically a Linux feature that ensures OS resources partition in a mutually exclusive manner. This forms the core concept behind containerization as namespaces introduce a layer of isolation amongst the containers. In docker, the namespaces ensure that the containers are portable and they don't affect the underlying host. Examples for namespace types that are currently being supported by Docker – PID, Mount, User, Network, IPC.</p>

            • <b>Docker Client:</b> This component performs “build” and “run” operations for the purpose of opening communication with the docker host.
            • <b>Docker Host:</b> This component has the main docker daemon and hosts containers and their associated images. The daemon establishes a connection with the docker registry.
            • <b>Docker Registry:</b> This component stores the docker images. There can be a public registry or a private one. The most famous public registries are Docker Hub and Docker Cloud.

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">• Yes, it is possible only while using certain docker-defined policies while using the docker run command. Following are the available policies:

            <b>1. Off:</b> In this, the container won’t be restarted in case it's stopped or it fails.
            <b>2. On-failure:</b> Here, the container restarts by itself only when it experiences failures not associated with the user.
            <b>3. Unless-stopped:</b> Using this policy, ensures that a container can restart only when the command is executed to stop it by the user.
            <b>4. Always:</b> Irrespective of the failure or stopping, the container always gets restarted in this type of policy.
            
            These policies can be used as:
            <code>docker run -dit — restart [restart-policy-value] [container_name]</code></p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">Can you tell the differences between a docker Image and Layer?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;"><b>Image:</b> This is built up from a series of read-only layers of instructions. An image corresponds to the docker container and is used for speedy operation due to the caching mechanism of each step.

            <b>Layer:</b> Each layer corresponds to an instruction of the image’s Dockerfile. In simple words, the layer is also an image but it is the image of the instructions run.
            
            Consider the example Dockerfile below.
            <code>FROM ubuntu:18.04 COPY . /myapp RUN make /myapp CMD python /myapp/app.py Importantly, each layer is only a set of differences from the layer before it.</code>
            
            - The result of building this docker file is an image. Whereas the instructions present in this file add the layers to the image. The layers can be thought of as intermediate images. In the example above, there are 4 instructions, hence 4 layers are added to the resultant image.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">• The syntax of docker run when using the volumes is: <code>docker run -v host_path:docker_path [container_name]</code>
            • The volume parameter is used for syncing a directory of a container with any of the host directories. Consider the below command as an example: <code>docker run -v /data/app:usr/src/app myapp</code>
            The above command mounts the directory <code>/data/app</code> in the host to the <code>usr/src/app</code> directory. We can sync the container with the data files from the host without having the need to restart it.
            • This also ensures data security in cases of container deletion. This ensures that even if the container is deleted, the data of the container exists in the volume mapped host location making it the easiest way to store the container data.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">• Using the up command for keeping a docker-compose up (ideally at all times), we can start or restart all the networks, services, and drivers associated with the app that are specified in the docker-compose.yml file. Now if we are running the docker-compose up in the “attached” mode then all the logs from the containers would be accessible to us. In case the docker-compose is run in the “detached” mode, then once the containers are started, it just exits and shows no logs.
            • Using the run command, the docker-compose can run one-off or ad-hoc tasks based on the business requirements. Here, the service name has to be provided and the docker starts only that specific service and also the other services to which the target service is dependent (if any).
            - This command is helpful for testing the containers and also performing tasks such as adding or removing data to the container volumes etc.
            • Using the start command, only those containers can be restarted which were already created and then stopped. This is not useful for creating new containers on its own.</p>

            • For the Windows platform, docker atleast needs Windows 10 64bit with 2GB RAM space. For the lower versions, docker can be installed by taking help of the toolbox. Docker can be downloaded from https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/ website.
            • For Linux platforms, Docker can run on various Linux flavors such as Ubuntu &gt;=12.04, Fedora &gt;=19, RHEL &gt;=6.5, CentOS &gt;=6 etc.</p>

            • <b>LABEL:</b> This is used for the image organization based on projects, modules, or licensing. It also helps in automation as we specify a key-value pair while defining a label that can be later accessed and handled programmatically.
            • <b>RUN:</b> This command is used to execute instructions following it on the top of the current image in a new layer. Note that with each RUN command execution, we add layers on top of the image and then use that in subsequent steps.
            • <b>CMD:</b> This command is used to provide default values of an executing container. In cases of multiple CMD commands the last instruction would be considered.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">• In docker, logging is supported at 2 levels and they are logging at the Daemon level or logging at the Container level.
            • <b>Daemon Level:</b> This kind of logging has four levels- Debug, Info, Error, and Fatal.
            - Debug has all the data that happened during the execution of the daemon process.
            - Info carries all the information along with the error information during the execution of the daemon process.
            - Errors have those errors that occurred during the execution of the daemon process.
            - Fatal has the fatal errors that occurred during the execution.
            • Container Level:
            - Container level logging can be done using the command: <code>sudo docker run –it <container_name> /bin/bash</container_name></code>
            - In order to check for the container level logs, we can run the command: sudo docker logs [container_id]</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">• CMD command provides executable defaults for an executing container. In case the executable has to be omitted then the usage of ENTRYPOINT instruction along with the JSON array format has to be incorporated.
            • ENTRYPOINT specifies that the instruction within it will always be run when the container starts. 
            This command provides an option to configure the parameters and the executables. If the DockerFile does not have this command, then it would still get inherited from the base image mentioned in the FROM instruction.
            - The most commonly used ENTRYPOINT is <code>/bin/sh</code> or <code>/bin/bash</code> for most of the base images.
            • As part of good practices, every DockerFile should have at least one of these two commands.</p>

But it all depends on the limitations - more specifically hardware restrictions. The size of the app and the CPU resources available are 2 important factors influencing this limit. In case your application is not very big and you have abundant CPU resources, then we can run a huge number of containers.</p>

            The most important stages are:
            
            • <b>Created:</b> This is the state where the container has just been created new but not started yet.
            • <b>Running:</b> In this state, the container would be running with all its associated processes.
            • <b>Paused:</b> This state happens when the running container has been paused.
            • <b>Stopped:</b> This state happens when the running container has been stopped.
            • <b>Deleted:</b> In this, the container is in a dead state.

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">• Docker-compose feature of docker will come to help here. In the docker-compose file, we can define multiple services, networks, and containers along with the volume mapping in a clean manner, and then we can just call the command “docker-compose up”.
            • When there are multiple environments involved - it can be either dev, staging, uat, or production servers, we would want to define the server-specific dependencies and processes for running the application. In this case, we can go ahead with creating environment-specific docker-compose files of the name “docker-compose.{environment}.yml” and then based on the environment, we can set up and run the application.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">How will you ensure that a container 1 runs before container 2 while using docker compose?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Docker-compose does not wait for any container to be “ready” before going ahead with the next containers. In order to achieve the order of execution, we can use:

            • The “depends_on” which got added in version 2 of docker-compose can be used as shown in a sample docker-compose.yml file below:
            
            <code>version: "2.4"
            services:
             backend:
               build: .
               depends_on:
                 - db
             db:
               image: postgres</code>

            The introduction of service dependencies has various causes and effects:
            
            • The <code>docker-compose up</code> command starts and runs the services in the dependency order specified. For the above example, the DB container is started before the backend.
            • <code>docker-compose up SERVICE_NAME</code> by default includes the dependencies associated with the service. In the given example, running <code>docker-compose up backend</code> creates and starts DB (dependency of backend).
            • Finally, the command <code>docker-compose stop</code> also stops the services in the order of the dependency specified. For the given example, the backend service is stopped before the DB service.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Kubernetes is a distributed open-source technology that helps us in scheduling and executing application containers within and across clusters. A Kubernetes cluster consists of two types of resources:

            The Master =&gt; Coordinates all activities in the cluster, for example, =&gt; scheduling applications, maintaining applications' state, scaling applications, and rolling out new updates
            
            Nodes =&gt; A node is an instance of an OS that serves as a worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster.
            
            Also, Node will have two components 
            
            • Kubelet =&gt; Agent for managing and communicating with the master
            • Tool (Docker/containers) =&gt; Tools for running container operations
            
            <img src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/myinterviewtrainer-domestic/public_assets/assets/000/000/132/original/Kubernetes_Cluster.jpg?1615463032" class="lozad">
            <i>Kubernetes Cluster</i>

             It is designed based on ground-up as a loosely coupled collection of containers centered around deploying, maintaining, and scaling workloads. Works as an engine for resolving state by converging actual and the desired state of the system (self-healing). Hidden from the underlying hardware of the nodes and provides a uniform interface for workloads to be both deployed and consume the shared pool of resources(hardware) in order to simplify deployment.
            
            Pods are the smallest unit of objects that can be deployed on Kubernetes, Kubernetes packages one or more containers into a higher-level structure called a pod. Pod runs one level higher to the container.
            
            A POD always runs on a Node but they share a few resources which can be Shared Volumes, Cluster Unique IP, Info about how to run each container.  All containers in the pod are going to be scheduled on an equivalent node.
            
            Services are the unified way of accessing the workloads on the pods, Control plane which is the core of Kubernetes is an API server that lets you query, manipulate the state of an object in Kubernetes.

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Whenever there are security patches available the Kubernetes administrator has to perform the maintenance task to apply the security patch to the running container in order to prevent it from vulnerability, which is often an unavoidable part of the administration. The following two commands are useful to safely drain the K8s node.

            • kubectl cordon
            • kubectl drain –ignore-daemon set

            The first command moves the node to maintenance mode or makes the node unavailable, followed by kubectl drain which will finally discard the pod from the node. After the drain command is a success you can perform maintenance.
            
            Note: If you wish to perform maintenance on a single pod following two commands can be issued in order:
            
            • kubectl get nodes: to list all the nodes
            • kubectl drain <node name="">: drain a particular node</node></p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">How do we control the resource usage of POD?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">With the use of limit and request resource usage of a POD can be controlled.

            Request: The number of resources being requested for a container. If a container exceeds its request for resources, it can be throttled back down to its request.
            
            Limit: An upper cap on the resources a single container can use. If it tries to exceed this predefined limit it can be terminated if K8's decides that another container needs these resources. If you are sensitive towards pod restarts, it makes sense to have the sum of all container resource limits equal to or less than the total resource capacity for your cluster.
            
            <b>Example:</b>
            
            <code>apiVersion: v1
            kind: Pod
            metadata:
             name: demo

               requests:
                 memory: "_Mi"
                 cpu: "_m"
               limits:
                 memory: "_Mi"
                 cpu: "_m"</code></p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What are the various K8's services running on nodes and describe the role of each service?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Mainly K8 cluster consists of two types of nodes, executor and master.

            <b>Executor node: (This runs on master node)</b>
            
            • Kube-proxy: This service is responsible for the communication of pods within the cluster and to the outside network, which runs on every node. This service is responsible to maintain network protocols when your pod establishes a network communication.
            • kubelet: Each node has a running kubelet service that updates the running node accordingly with the configuration(YAML or JSON) file. NOTE: kubelet service is only for containers created by Kubernetes.
            
            <b>Master services:</b>
            
            • Kube-apiserver: Master API service which acts as an entry point to K8 cluster.

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A Kubernetes administrator can create a deployment of a kind: PodDisruptionBudget for high availability of the application, it makes sure that the minimum number is running pods are respected as mentioned by the attribute minAvailable spec file. This is useful while performing a drain where the drain will halt until the PDB is respected to ensure the High Availability(HA) of the application. The following spec file also shows minAvailable as 2 which implies the minimum number of an available pod (even after the election).

            Example: YAML Config using minAvailable =&gt; 
            
            <code>apiVersion: policy/v1beta1

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Load balancing is a way to distribute the incoming traffic into multiple backend servers, which is useful to ensure the application available to the users.

            <i>Load Balancer</i>

            In Kubernetes, as shown in the above figure all the incoming traffic lands to a single IP address on the load balancer which is a way to expose your service to outside the internet which routes the incoming traffic to a particular pod (via service) using an algorithm known as round-robin. Even if any pod goes down load balances are notified so that the traffic is not routed to that particular unavailable node. Thus load balancers in Kubernetes are responsible for distributing a set of tasks (incoming traffic) to the pods</p>

            • RBAC (Role-based access control) to narrow down the permissions.
            • Use namespaces to establish security boundaries.

            • Node level logging agent.
            • Streaming sidecar container.
            • Sidecar container with the logging agent.
            • Export logs directly from the application.

            In the setup, journalbeat and filebeat are running as daemonset. Logs collected by these are dumped to the kafka topic which is eventually dumped to the ELK stack.
            
            The same can be achieved using EFK stack and fluentd-bit.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Over the course of time, using the default namespace alone is proving to be difficult, since you are unable to get a good overview of all the applications you can manage within the cluster as a whole. The namespaces allow applications to be organized into groups that make sense, such as a namespace for all monitoring applications and another for all security applications. 

            Additionally, namespaces can be used for managing Blue/Green environments, in which each namespace contains its own version of an app as well as sharing resources with other namespaces (such as logging or monitoring). It is also possible to have one cluster with multiple teams using namespaces. The use of the same cluster by multiple teams may lead to conflict.  Suppose they end up creating an app that has the same name, this means that one team will override the app created by the other team as Kubernetes prohibits two apps with the same name (within the same namespace).</p>

Therefore, managing stateful applications often requires a human operator. This is supposed to be assisted by Kubernetes Operator.

            • The installation procedure of the K8s is very complicated but if it is once installed then the cluster is robust. On the other hand, the Docker swarm installation process is very simple but the cluster is not at all robust.
            • Kubernetes can process the auto-scaling but the Docker swarm cannot process the auto-scaling of the pods based on incoming load.
            • Kubernetes is a full-fledged Framework. Since it maintains the cluster states more consistently so autoscaling is not as fast as Docker Swarm.</p>

            • nodeSelector: Assign a specific label to the node which has special resources and use the same label in POD spec so that POD will run only on that node.
            • nodeaffinities: required DuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution, preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution are hard and soft requirements for running the POD on specific nodes. This will be replacing nodeSelector in the future. It depends on the node labels.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What are the different ways to provide external network connectivity to K8?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">By default, POD should be able to reach the external network but vice-versa we need to make some changes. Following options are available to connect with POD from the outer world.

            • Nodeport (it will expose one port on each node to communicate with it)
            • Load balancers (L4 layer of TCP/IP protocol)
            • Ingress (L7 layer of TCP/IP Protocol)

            Another method is to use Kube-proxy which can expose a service with only cluster IP on the local system port.
            
            $ kubectl proxy --port=8080 $ http://localhost:8080/api/v1/proxy/namespaces//services/:/</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">How can we forward the port '8080 (container) -&gt; 8080 (service) -&gt; 8080 (ingress) -&gt; 80 (browser)and how it can be done?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">The ingress is exposing port 80 externally for the browser to access, and connecting to a service that listens on 8080. The ingress will listen on port 80 by default. An "ingress controller" is a pod that receives external traffic and handles the ingress and is configured by an ingress resource For this you need to configure the ingress selector and if no 'ingress controller selector' is mentioned then no ingress controller will manage the ingress.

            Simple ingress Config will look like
            
            <code>host: abc.org
            http:
            paths:
            backend:
            serviceName: abc-service
            servicePort: 8080
            Then the service will look like
            kind: Service
            apiVersion: v1
            metadata:
            name: abc-service
            spec:
            ports:
            protocol: TCP
            port: 8080 # port to which the service listens to
            targetPort: 8080</code></p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Kubernetes is used because:

            • Kubernetes can run on-premises bare metal, OpenStack, public clouds Google, Azure, AWS, etc.
            • It helps you to avoid vendor lock issues as it can use any vendor-specific APIs or services except where Kubernetes provides an abstraction, e.g., load balancer and storage.
            • It will enable applications that need to be released and updated without any downtime.
            • Kubernetes allows you to assure those containerized apps run where and when you want and help you to find resources and tools which you want to work.</p>

It is the entry point for all kinds of administrative tasks. There may be more than one master node in the cluster to check for fault tolerance.
            • <b>API Server:</b> The API server acts as an entry point for all the REST commands used for controlling the cluster.
            • <b>Scheduler:</b> The scheduler schedules the tasks to the slave node. It stores the resource usage information for every slave node. It is responsible for distributing the workload.
            • <b>Etcd:</b> etcd components, store configuration detail, and wright values. It communicates with the most component to receive commands and work. It also manages network rules and port forwarding activity.
            • <b>Worker/Slave nodes:</b> Worker nodes are another essential component that contains all the required services to manage the networking between the containers, communicate with the master node, which allows you to assign resources to the scheduled containers.
            • <b>Kubelet:</b> It gets the configuration of a Pod from the API server and ensures that the described containers are up and running.
            • <b>Docker Container:</b> Docker container runs on each of the worker nodes, which runs the configured pods.
            • <b>Pods:</b> A pod is a combination of single or multiple containers that logically run together on nodes.

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">We can separate the risky, confidential, and experimental changes from our original codebase with the help of forks. A fork is a whole new copy of code collections that include commits, branches, and files. A fork seems like a repository that has been cloned and pushed to a new and empty repository. The fork files and branches can't be shared with the original codebase once a fork is created. But a pull request can carry them along.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">They are the logical hardware groups that can share the same power source as well as network. They are used for racking the data centers on-premise. These fault domains get automatically distributed by the Azure platform when VMs are designed using available sets. This approach limits network outages, physical hardware failures, etc.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">How do you create a build pipeline for Azure?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">You can create a build pipeline for Azure by using the Azure Pipelines service. This service allows you to create and manage build pipelines for your Azure projects. To create a build pipeline, you will need to first create an Azure DevOps account. Once you have an account, you can then create a new build pipeline by going to the Azure Pipelines service and selecting the “New Pipeline” button.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">Can you give me a few examples of how Azure Pipelines can be used to automate deployments?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Azure Pipelines can be used to automate just about any type of deployment you can imagine. A few examples include:

            • Deploying a website or web application to a web server
            • Deploying a mobile app to a mobile device
            • Deploying a desktop application to a desktop
            • Deploying a cloud service to Azure
            • Deploying a virtual machine to Azure
            • Deploying a database to Azure</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">Can you give me an example of when you might want to add custom code to your pipeline?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">There are many reasons why you might want to add custom code to your Azure Pipeline. For example, you might want to add custom code to perform a specific task that is not already included in the pipeline, or you might want to add code to customize the behavior of an existing task. In either case, custom code can help you to achieve your specific goals for the pipeline.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Following are the three cloud deployment models:

            • <b>Public Cloud</b>: The infrastructure is owned by your cloud provider and the server that you are using could be a multi-tenant system.
            • <b>Private Cloud</b>: The infrastructure is owned by you or your cloud provider gives you that service exclusively. For eg: Hosting your website on your servers, or hosting your website with the cloud provider on a dedicated server.
            • <b>Hybrid Cloud</b>: When you use both Public Cloud, Private Cloud together, it is called Hybrid Cloud. For Example: Using your in-house servers for confidential data, and the public cloud for hosting your company’s public-facing website. This type of setup would be a hybrid cloud.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">An availability set is a logical grouping of VMs that allows Azure to understand how your application is built to provide redundancy and availability. It is recommended that two or more VMs are created within an availability set to provide for a highly available application and to meet the 99.95% Azure SLA. When a single VM is used with Azure Premium Storage, the Azure SLA applies for unplanned maintenance events.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A <b>fault domain</b> is a logical group of the underlying hardware that share a common power source and network switch, similar to a rack within an on-premise data-centers. As you create VMs within an availability set, the Azure platform automatically distributes your VMs across these fault domains. This approach limits the impact of potential physical hardware failures, network outages, or power interruptions.

            An <b>update domain</b> is a logical group of the underlying hardware that can undergo maintenance or can be rebooted at the same time. As you create VMs within an availability set, the Azure platform automatically distributes your VMs across these update domains. This approach ensures that at least one instance of your application always remains running as the Azure platform undergoes periodic maintenance. The order of update domains being rebooted may not proceed sequentially during planned maintenance, but only one update domain is rebooted at a time.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Auto-scaling is a way to automatically scale up or down the number of computing resources that are being allocated to your application based on its needs at any given time.

            The key point is that you can now design a scalable architecture that will automatically scale up or scale down to meet your needs over the lifetime of your setup regardless of how fast/slow or big/small your site grows over that time.
            
            Here are the most popular ways of autoscaling:
            
            • Horizontal Scaling
            • Vertical Scaling</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">The Azure Storage Queue is simple and the developer experience is quite good. It uses the local Azure Storage Emulator and debugging is made quite easy. The tooling for Azure Storage Queues allows you to easily peek at the top 32 messages and if the messages are in XML or JSON, you’re able to visualize their contents directly from Visual Studio Furthermore, these queues can be purged of their contents, which is especially useful during development and QA efforts.

            The Azure Service Bus Queues are evolved and surrounded by many useful mechanisms that make it enterprise worthy! They are built into the Service Bus and are able to forward messages to other Queues and Topics. They have a built-in dead-letter queue and messages have a time to live that you control, hence messages don’t automatically disappear after 7 days.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">You can know that you are paying the correct amount for the resources that you are using by employing the following resources:
            
            • Check the Top Services Table
            It is a dashboard in the cost management console that shows you the top five most used services. This will let you know how much money you are spending on the resources in question.
            
            • Cost Explorer
            There are cost explorer services available that will help you to view and analyze your usage costs for the last 13 months. You can also get a cost forecast for the upcoming three months.
            
            • AWS Budgets
            This allows you to plan a budget for the services. Also, it will enable you to check if the current plan meets your budget and the details of how you use the services.
            
            • Cost Allocation Tags
            This helps in identifying the resource that has cost more in a particular month. It lets you organize your resources and cost allocation tags to keep track of your AWS costs.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Most of the AWS services have their logging options. Also, some of them have an account level logging, like in AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, and others. Let’s take a look at two services in specific:
            
            • AWS CloudTrail
            This is a service that provides a history of the AWS API calls for every account. It lets you perform security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing of your AWS environment as well. The best part about this service is that it enables you to configure it to send notifications via AWS SNS when new logs are delivered.
            
            • AWS Config 
            This helps you understand the configuration changes that happen in your environment. This service provides an AWS inventory that includes configuration history, configuration change notification, and relationships between AWS resources. It can also be configured to send information via AWS SNS when new logs are delivered.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">DDoS is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator accesses a website and creates multiple sessions so that the other legitimate users cannot access the service. The native tools that can help you deny the DDoS attacks on your AWS services are:
            
            • AWS Shield
            • AWS WAF
            • Amazon Route53

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Not all Amazon AWS services are available in all regions. When Amazon initially launches a new service, it doesn’t get immediately published in all the regions. They start small and then slowly expand to other regions. So, if you don’t see a specific service in your region, chances are the service hasn’t been published in your region yet. However, if you want to get the service that is not available, you can switch to the nearest region that provides the services.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Amazon CloudWatch helps you to monitor the application status of various AWS services and custom events. It helps you to monitor:
            
            • State changes in Amazon EC2
            • Auto-scaling lifecycle events
            • Scheduled events

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">The three major types of virtualization in AWS are: 
            
            • Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM)
            It is a fully virtualized hardware, where all the virtual machines act separate from each other. These virtual machines boot by executing a master boot record in the root block device of your image.
            
            • Paravirtualization (PV)
            Paravirtualization-GRUB is the bootloader that boots the PV AMIs. The PV-GRUB chain loads the kernel specified in the menu.
            
            • Paravirtualization on HVM
            PV on HVM helps operating systems take advantage of storage and network I/O available through the host.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Availability zones are geographically separate locations. As a result, failure in one zone has no effect on EC2 instances in other zones. When it comes to regions, they may have one or more availability zones. This configuration also helps to reduce latency and costs.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">The image that will be used to boot an EC2 instance is stored on the root device drive. This occurs when an Amazon AMI runs a new EC2 instance. And this root device volume is supported by EBS or an instance store. In general, the root device data on Amazon EBS is not affected by the lifespan of an EC2 instance.</p>

            2. Compute Optimized Instances: These are ideal for compute-intensive applications. They can handle  batch processing workloads, high-performance web servers, machine learning inference, and various other tasks.
            3. Memory Optimized: They process workloads that handle massive datasets in memory and deliver them quickly.
            4. Accelerated Computing: It aids in the execution of floating-point number calculations, data pattern matching, and graphics processing. These functions are carried out using hardware accelerators.
            5. Storage Optimised: They handle tasks that require sequential read and write access to big data sets on local storage.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">No, standby instances are launched in different availability zones than the primary, resulting in physically separate infrastructures. This is because the entire purpose of standby instances is to prevent infrastructure failure. As a result, if the primary instance fails, the backup instance will assist in recovering all of the data.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Spot instances are unused EC2 instances that users can use at a reduced cost.
            
            When you use on-demand instances, you must pay for computing resources without making long-term obligations.
            
            Reserved instances, on the other hand, allow you to specify attributes such as instance type, platform, tenancy, region, and availability zone. Reserved instances offer significant reductions and capacity reservations when instances in certain availability zones are used.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">To make limit administration easier for customers, Amazon EC2 now offers the option to switch from the current 'instance count-based limitations' to the new 'vCPU Based restrictions.' As a result, when launching a combination of instance types based on demand, utilization is measured in terms of the number of vCPUs.</p>

They can be produced manually or automatically at any moment. Your resources can always be restored using snapshots, even after they have been created. These resources will also perform the same tasks as the original ones from which the snapshots were made.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">EC2 is short for Elastic Compute Cloud, and it provides scalable computing capacity. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates the need to invest in hardware, leading to faster development and deployment of applications. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as needed, configure security and networking, and manage storage. It can scale up or down to handle changes in requirements, reducing the need to forecast traffic. EC2 provides virtual computing environments called “instances.”</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Security best practices for Amazon EC2 include using Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to AWS resources; restricting access by only allowing trusted hosts or networks to access ports on an instance; only opening up those permissions you require, and disabling password-based logins for instances launched from your AMI.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">Can S3 Be Used with EC2 Instances, and If Yes, How?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Amazon S3 can be used for instances with root devices backed by local instance storage. That way, developers have access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites. To execute systems in the Amazon EC2 environment, developers load Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) into Amazon S3 and then move them between Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2.
            
            Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 are two of the best-known web services that make up AWS.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is the difference between stopping and terminating an EC2 instance?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">While you may think that both stopping and terminating are the same, there is a difference. When you stop an EC2 instance, it performs a normal shutdown on the instance and moves to a stopped state. However, when you terminate the instance, it is transferred to a stopped state, and the EBS volumes attached to it are deleted and can never be recovered.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">The three types of EC2 instances are:
            
            • On-demand Instance
            It is cheap for a short time but not when taken for the long term
            
            • Spot Instance
            It is less expensive than the on-demand instance and can be bought through bidding. 
            
            • Reserved Instance
            If you are planning to use an instance for a year or more, then this is the right one for you.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What Is Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Why Is It Used?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">A VPC is the best way of connecting to your cloud resources from your own data center. Once you connect your datacenter to the VPC in which your instances are present, each instance is assigned a private IP address that can be accessed from your data center. That way, you can access your public cloud resources as if they were on your own private network.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">AWS IAM allows an administrator to provide multiple users and groups with granular access. Various user groups and users may require varying levels of access to the various resources that have been developed. We may assign roles to users and create roles with defined access levels using IAM.
            
            It further gives us Federated Access, which allows us to grant applications and users access to resources without having to create IAM Roles.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Connection Draining is an AWS service that allows us to serve current requests on the servers that are either being decommissioned or updated.
            
            By enabling this Connection Draining, we let the Load Balancer make an outgoing instance finish its existing requests for a set length of time before sending it any new requests. A departing instance will immediately go off if Connection Draining is not enabled, and all pending requests will fail.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">The AWS Resources owner is identical to an Administrator User. The Administrator User can build, change, delete, and inspect resources, as well as grant permissions to other AWS users.
            
            Administrator Access without the ability to control users and permissions is provided to a Power User. A Power User Access user cannot provide permissions to other users but has the ability to modify, remove, view, and create resources.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Here are some differences between AWS CloudFormation and AWS Elastic Beanstalk:
            
            • AWS CloudFormation helps you provision and describe all of the infrastructure resources that are present in your cloud environment. On the other hand, AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides an environment that makes it easy to deploy and run applications in the cloud.
            • AWS CloudFormation supports the infrastructure needs of various types of applications, like legacy applications and existing enterprise applications. On the other hand, AWS Elastic Beanstalk is combined with the developer tools to help you manage the lifecycle of your applications.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What are the elements of an AWS CloudFormation template?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">AWS CloudFormation templates are YAML or JSON formatted text files that are comprised of five essential elements, they are:
            
            • Template parameters
            • Output values
            • Data tables
            • Resources
            • File format version</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What happens when one of the resources in a stack cannot be created successfully?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">If the resource in the stack cannot be created, then the CloudFormation automatically rolls back and terminates all the resources that were created in the CloudFormation template. This is a handy feature when you accidentally exceed your limit of Elastic IP addresses or don’t have access to an EC2 AMI.

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Use the following steps in order to automate EC2 backup using EBS:
            
            Get the list of instances and connect to AWS through API to list the Amazon EBS volumes that are attached locally to the instance.
            List the snapshots of each volume, and assign a retention period of the snapshot. Later on, create a snapshot of each volume.
            Make sure to remove the snapshot if it is older than the retention period.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What is the difference between EBS and Instance Store?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">EBS is a kind of permanent storage in which the data can be restored at a later point. When you save data in the EBS, it stays even after the lifetime of the EC2 instance. On the other hand, Instance Store is temporary storage that is physically attached to a host machine. With an Instance Store, you cannot detach one instance and attach it to another. Unlike in EBS, data in an Instance Store is lost if any instance is stopped or terminated.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Yes, you can use the EFS-to-EFS backup solution to recover from unintended changes or deletion in Amazon EFS. Follow these steps:
            
            1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console
            2. Click the launch EFS-to-EFS-restore button
            3. Use the region selector in the console navigation bar to select region

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Using AWS IAM, you can do the following:
            
            • Create and manage IAM users
            • Create and manage IAM groups
            • Manage the security credentials of the users

            • You can set a minimum length of the password, or you can ask the users to add at least one number or special characters in it.
            • You can assign requirements of particular character types, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters.
            • You can enforce automatic password expiration, prevent reuse of old passwords, and request for a password reset upon their next AWS sign in.
            • You can have the AWS users contact an account administrator when the user has allowed the password to expire.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">The two key differences between the IAM role and IAM user are:
            
            • An IAM role is an IAM entity that defines a set of permissions for making AWS service requests, while an IAM user has permanent long-term credentials and is used to interact with the AWS services directly.  
            • In the IAM role, trusted entities, like IAM users, applications, or an AWS service, assume roles whereas the IAM user has full access to all the AWS IAM functionalities.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">CloudTrail is a service that captures information about every request sent to the Amazon Route 53 API by an AWS account, including requests that are sent by IAM users. CloudTrail saves log files of these requests to an Amazon S3 bucket. CloudTrail captures information about all requests. You can use information in the CloudTrail log files to determine which requests were sent to Amazon Route 53, the IP address that the request was sent from, who sent the request, when it was sent, and more.</p>

            A domain is a collection of data describing a self-contained administrative and technical unit. For example, www.simplilearn.com is a domain and a general DNS concept.
            
            • Hosted zone
            A hosted zone is a container that holds information about how you want to route traffic on the internet for a specific domain. For example, lms.simplilearn.com is a hosted zone.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Here’s how Amazon Route 53 provides the resources in question:
            
            • Globally Distributed Servers
            Amazon is a global service and consequently has DNS services globally. Any customer creating a query from any part of the world gets to reach a DNS server local to them that provides low latency. 
            
            • Dependency
            Route 53 provides a high level of dependability required by critical applications
            
            • Optimal Locations
            Route 53 uses a global anycast network to answer queries from the optimal position automatically.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">AWS CloudTrail records user API activity on your account and allows you to access information about the activity. Using CloudTrail, you can get full details about API actions such as the identity of the caller, time of the call, request parameters, and response elements. On the other hand, AWS Config records point-in-time configuration details for your AWS resources as Configuration Items (CIs). 
            
            You can use a CI to ascertain what your AWS resource looks like at any given point in time. Whereas, by using CloudTrail, you can quickly answer who made an API call to modify the resource. You can also use Cloud Trail to detect if a security group was incorrectly configured.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">There are two types of scaling - vertical scaling and horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling lets you vertically scale up your master database with the press of a button. A database can only be scaled vertically, and there are 18 different instances in which you can resize the RDS. On the other hand, horizontal scaling is good for replicas. These are read-only replicas that can only be done through Amazon Aurora.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">RDS maintenance window lets you decide when DB instance modifications, database engine version upgrades, and software patching have to occur. The automatic scheduling is done only for patches that are related to security and durability. By default, there is a 30-minute value assigned as the maintenance window and the DB instance will still be available during these events though you might observe a minimal effect on performance.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What are the consistency models in DynamoDB?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">There are two consistency models In DynamoDB. First, there is the Eventual Consistency Model, which maximizes your read throughput. However, it might not reflect the results of a recently completed write. Fortunately, all the copies of data usually reach consistency within a second. The second model is called the Strong Consistency Model. This model has a delay in writing the data, but it guarantees that you will always see the updated data every time you read it.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">What type of query functionality does DynamoDB support?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">DynamoDB supports GET/PUT operations by using a user-defined primary key. It provides flexible querying by letting you query on non-primary vital attributes using global secondary indexes and local secondary indexes.</p>

A buffer will synchronize different components and makes the arrangement additionally elastic to a burst of load or traffic. The components are prone to work in an unstable way of receiving and processing requests. The buffer creates an equilibrium linking various apparatus and crafts them to work at an identical rate to supply more rapid services.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">Why do we make subnets?</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Creating subnets means dividing a large network into smaller ones. These subnets can be created for several reasons. For example, creating and using subnets can help reduce congestion by making sure that the traffic destined for a subnet stays in that subnet. This helps in efficiently routing the traffic coming to the network that reduces the network’s load.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Yes, it is possible by using the multipart upload utility from AWS. With the multipart upload utility, larger files can be uploaded in multiple parts that are uploaded independently. You can also decrease upload time by uploading these parts in parallel. After the upload is done, the parts will be merged into a single object or file to create the original file from which the parts were created.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">The classic load balancer is used for simple load balancing of traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
            
            <img src="https://intellipaat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/AWS-IQ.jpg" class="lozad">

            While, the application load balancing is used for more intelligent load balancing, based on the multi-tier architecture or container-based architecture of the application. Application load balancing is mostly used when there is a need to route traffic to multiple services.

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">VPC is the abbreviated form of Virtual Private Cloud. It allows you to launch AWS resources that can be defined by you and fully customize the network configurations. Through VPC, you can define and take full control of your virtual network environment. For example- you can have a private address range, internet gateways, subnets, etc.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">AMI stands for Amazon Machine Images. It includes the following:
            
            • Single or multiple Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots. Basically, templates for the root volume of the instance.
            • Launch permissions that let AWS accounts use AMI to launch instances.
            • A block device mapping to specify what volumes to be attached to the instance during its launch.</p>

            • S3 Standard - It is by and large the default storage class. In cases where no specification about the storage class is provided while uploading the object, Amazon S3 assigns the S3 Standard storage class by default.
            • Reduced Redundancy - It is assigned when non-critical, reproducible data needs to be stored. The Reduced Redundancy Storage class is designed in a way that the above data categories can be stored with less redundancy. 
            
            However, it is always advisable to go ahead with the S3 Standard storage class.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Policies define the permissions required to execute an operation irrespective of the method used to perform it. AWS supports six types of policies:
            
            • Identity-based policies
            • Resource-based policies
            • Permissions boundaries
            • Organizations SCPs
            • ACLs
            • Session policies
            
            1- Identity-based policies- They are JSON permissions policy documents that control what actions an identity can perform, under what conditions, and on which resources. These policies are further classified into 2 categories:
            
            • Managed Policies– These policies are standalone identity-based policies that can be attached to different users, groups in your AWS environment.
            • Inline policies- These policies are directly attached to a single user, group, or role. In situations where inline policies are used, a strict one-to-one relationship between a policy and an identity is maintained. 

            2- Resource-based policies- These policies are the ones attached to a resource such as an Amazon S3 bucket. They define which actions can be performed on the particular resource and under what circumstances.
            
            3- IAM permissions boundaries- They actually refer to the maximum level of permissions that identity-based policies can grant to the specific entity.
            
            4- Service Control Policies (SCPs)- SCPs are the maximum level of permissions for an organization or organizational unit. 
            
            5- Access Control lists- They define and control which principals in another AWS account can access the particular resource.
            
            6- Session policies- They are advanced policies that are passed as a parameter when a temporary session is programmatically created for a role or federated user.</p>

                        <p class="lead1" style="white-space: pre-line;">Create an AMI of the server running in the North Virginia region. Once the AMI is created, The administrator would need the 12 digit account number of the #2 AWS account. This is required for copying the AMI which we have created.
            
            Once the AMI is successfully copied into the Mumbai region, you can launch the instance using copied AMI in the Mumbai region. Once the instance is running and if it’s completely operational, the server in the North Virginia region could be terminated. This is the best way to migrate a server to a different account without any hassle.

Instead of using EFS, our company is recommending the use of multi-attach volume with instances. As an architect, you need to suggest them what instance type and EBS volumes they should use.</p>

                        <p class="h3 border-bottom">A company is using a VPC peering connection option to connect its multiple VPCs in a single region to allow for cross VPC communication. A recent increase in account creations and VPCs has made it difficult to maintain the VPC peering strategy, and the company expects to grow to hundreds of VPCs. There are also new requests to create site-to-site VPNs with some of the VPCs. A solutions architect has been tasked with creating a centrally networking setup for multiple accounts and VPNs. Which networking solution would you recommend to resolve it?</p>
